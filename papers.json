We propose a structured four-phase framework, SARA (Selection, Acquisition, Refinement, and Analysis), which integrates and extends state-of-the-art techniques for large-scale review collection, filtering, and analysis using prompt-based LLMs. First, we empirically validate the reliability of LLMs for topic extraction and assignment, achieving 91% accuracy through five-shot prompting and LLM-based filtering of non-informative reviews. We then apply the framework to informative reviews to identify the ten most discussed topics (e.g., AI Performance, Content Quality, and Content Policy&Censorship) and analyze the key challenges and emerging opportunities. Finally, we examine how these topics evolve over time, offering insight into shifting user expectations and engagement patterns with Gen-AI apps.

However, efficient construction and utilization of CKMs require high-quality, massive, and location-specific channel knowledge data that accurately reflects the real-world environments. Inspired by the great success of ImageNet dataset in advancing computer vision and image understanding in artificial intelligence (AI) community, we introduce CKMImageNet, a dataset developed to bridge AI and environment-aware wireless communications and sensing by integrating location-specific channel knowledge data, high-fidelity environmental maps, and their visual representations. CKMImageNet supports a wide range of AI-driven approaches for CKM construction with spatially consistent and location-specific channel knowledge data, including both supervised and unsupervised, as well as discriminative and generative AI methods. The dataset is built using advanced ray-tracing techniques, ensuring high fidelity and environmental accuracy. By addressing key challenges in CKM construction and enabling AI models to learn environment-aware propagation patterns, CKMImageNet may serve as a foundational tool for advancing environment-aware 6G systems, ranging from network planning such as communication base station (BS) site selection and sensing anchor node placement, to pro-active resource allocation such as beam alignment, power allocation, interference avoidance, clutter rejection, and robot trajectory planning. Compared with existing datasets like RadioMapSeer, CKMImageNet not only provides numerical and visual representation to channel gain values, but also more diversified channel knowledge like multipath angles of arrival (AoAs) and path delays.

This article reviews the potential use of generative AI chatbots for purposes such as note-writing, handoffs, and prior authorisation letters, and the ethical considerations arising from their use in this context. AI-generated documentation may offer standardised and consistent documentation across encounters but may also embed biases that can spread across clinical teams relying on previous notes or handoffs, compromising clinical judgement, especially for vulnerable populations such as cognitively impaired or non-English-speaking patients. These tools may transform clinician\u2013patient relationships by reducing administrative work and enhancing shared decision-making but may also compromise the emotional and moral elements of patient care. Moreover, the lack of algorithmic transparency raises concerns that may complicate the determination of responsibility when errors occur. To address these considerations, we propose notifying patients when the use of AI-generated clinical documentation meaningfully impacts their understanding of care, requiring clinician review of drafts, and clarifying areas of ambiguity to protect patient autonomy. Generative AI-specific legislation, error reporting databases and accountable measures for clinicians and AI developers can promote transparency.

To address these challenges, defense and mitigation techniques are required. Identifying and detecting anomalies in information and communication technology (ICT) is crucial to ensure secure device interactions within digital substations. This paper proposes a task-oriented dialogue (ToD) system for anomaly detection (AD) in datasets of multicast messages e.g., generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) and sampled value (SV) in digital substations using large language models (LLMs). This model has a lower potential error and better scalability and adaptability than a process that considers the cybersecurity guidelines recommended by humans, known as the human-in-the-loop (HITL) process. Also, this methodology significantly reduces the effort required when addressing new cyber threats or anomalies compared with machine learning (ML) techniques, since it leaves the models complexity and precision unaffected and offers a faster implementation. These findings present a comparative assessment, conducted utilizing standard and advanced performance evaluation metrics for the proposed AD framework and the HITL process. To generate and extract datasets of IEC 61850 communications, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed was employed."}

This article introduces a Multiple Knowledge Guided Summarization (Multi-KGS) model designed to generate meteorological decision reports by fusing posts from Sina Weibo. Specifically, the Multi-KGS model comprises a summary generation module and a multiple knowledge guidance module. The summary generation module synthesizes the content of the decision report, while the multiple knowledge guidance module steers and constrains the summarization process using knowledge of meteorological events and geographical locations, ensuring that the generated report highlights the core knowledge expressed in the source posts.

However, clinical trials are highly regulated, and the guidance on the use of AI in trials has not yet been developed. Once these challenges are overcome or in the appropriate setting, AI can offer significant speed and cost advantage across all stages of clinical trials. In the planning stage, AI can simulate patient journey to enable patient-centric study design and identify the patient pool and investigational sites based on eligibility criteria. The tools can run multiple scenarios on timeline, cost, and complexity to determine feasibility. Generative AI can be used to create study documents. During study conduct, AI can be deployed to identify risks for data quality and integrity enabling reduction in monitoring visits and potentially reducing carbon footprint. AI can predict event accrual and data cleaning using machine learning. During study closeout, AI can accelerate data query resolution by bots and reduce site burden. The generative AI applied during the creation of study documents can be efficiently used to write study reports and generate tables and figures. In summary, AI has the potential to improve the efficiency of clinical trials, and if development is successful, AI can even potentially reduce the cost of drug to the patient."}

Prior research suggests that older people are less likely than their younger counterparts to use generative AI (NORC, 2023), but older adults\u2019 attitudes toward AI technologies remain relatively obscure. Drawing on data from a national online survey study of American adults between ages 18 to 96 (N\u2009=\u20091008), this study examines older adults\u2019 experiences with AI and openness to receiving advice from AI-enabled tools. The survey included questions about experiences with AI and using AI-enabled chatbots for general use and advice. Preliminary findings indicate that most older adults had some level of familiarity with AI-enabled technologies, with nearly three-quarters (73.7%) of respondents aged 60 and older at least \u201ca little\u201d familiar. However, fewer (28.3%) in this age group reported having used AI-enabled technology. Older adults exhibited greater skepticism toward AI-generated advice than younger respondents; compared to younger age groups, fewer older respondents (36.0%) considered AI to be a valid source of advice, and 34.7% of older respondents indicated that they did not at all trust AI-enabled tools at all to give good advice. Mean trust scores also declined with age. These findings contribute to understanding about attitudes toward and adoption of AI across age groups. As generative AI becomes an increasingly common presence in everyday life, knowing how different generations engage with these tools is essential for understanding how they may be adopted, the extent of their disruptive potential, and the emergences of disparities of access."}

It has been found that the systematic implementation of AI in learning processes, knowledge assessment, and clinical training promotes the personalization of education and reduces the risk of medical errors. At the same time, a low level of awareness is noted among students pursuing higher medical education regarding the possibilities of AI, especially in the context of the practical application of these technologies in clinical activities. \nThe article presents data from cross-sectional surveys which show that although most students recognize the potential of AI, they also highlight ethical risks, the danger of reduced empathy, and the need for standardized approaches to teaching digital technologies. Updates to educational programs in line with current digital trends are proposed, including theoretical modules on Machine Learning, large language models (LLMs), and generative AI (GenAI), as well as practical training under the guidance of competent faculty. Emphasis is placed on the importance of developing international regulatory and legal frameworks to govern AI usage in medical education and clinical practice, ensuring algorithmic transparency and adherence to ethical principles. \nIt is concluded that the proper integration of AI in medical education will not only significantly improve the quality of training for future physicians and enhance the effectiveness of the learning process but will also provide graduates with competitive advantages in the rapidly evolving technological landscape."}

Recent studies consistently highlight students'(mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes. This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education (CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future. Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting; (2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI."}

As a result, current interventions fail to capitalize on the underlying mechanisms that are common across different types of stereotypes, and to anchor on particular aspects that are relevant in certain cases. In this paper, we draw on social psychological research and build on NLP data and methods, to propose a unified framework to operationalize stereotypes in generative AI evaluations. Our framework identifies key components of stereotypes that are crucial in AI evaluation, including the target group, associated attribute, relationship characteristics, perceiving group, and context.

As digital media increasingly rely on data-driven strategies to influence consumer behavior, understanding how these algorithms shape user experiences becomes paramount. By employing a qualitative exploratory study, this paper investigates the implications of personalized advertising on user choice and autonomy. Through multiple intensive interviews with MENA region end-users, we assess how geo-targeted algorithms curate advertising content, often leading to experiences that users perceive as both personalized and compromised. The findings may reveal that while users appreciate the relevance of personalized advertisements, they simultaneously express concerns about their autonomy and the extent of their informed choice. This study relies on media system dependency theory to illustrate how reliance on digital platforms shapes the user expectations and behaviors. The insights from the analysis may underscore the need to critically evaluate how geo-targeted advertising not only influences user decisions but also impacts the perceptions of advertising in the digital landscape. Ultimately, this research may provide broader knowledge in media studies by highlighting the ethical implications of algorithmic personalization in digital advertising. As advertisers navigate the challenges posed by data-driven marketing, the study may advocate for greater transparency and user empowerment in the advertising ecosystem. By examining the complex relationship between algorithmic personalization and user autonomy, this paper may contribute to understanding of the importance of fostering an informed and autonomous user base in the MENA region and beyond."}

Upon its release, many marveled at its ability to author intelligible and generically responsible texts (Herman). Writing about his students\u2019 experiences using artificial intelligence (AI) writing assistants, S. Scott Graham remarks that the results were \u201cconsistently mediocre\u2014and usually quite obvious in their fabrication.\u201d Why might this be true? How can an LLM succeed in some respects and fail in others? We argue that the discrepant reactions to human and AI rhetoric are a question of genre, specifically that AI rhetoric is only generic; AI rhetoric represents a new enactment of \u201cwriting degree zero\u201d (Barthes) that is disengaged from immediate rhetorical situations and knowledge bases. AI text generators (currently) have a more difficult time simulating the positioned perspectives that human writers bring to situations and communicate to audiences through their genre usage. Drawing on the work of Bakhtin, we treat this problem as a question of generic form and audience addressivity. We describe the interplay of form and addressivity as genre signaling and offer it as a construct for the analysis of AI rhetoric and genre as a cultural form (Miller). Genre signaling (Hart-Davidson and Omizo) describes a feature of communicative behavior as it occurs over time that can help both humans and machines evaluate written discourse as it exhibits certain stabilized formal features. When texts contain specific genre signals at expected frequencies and intensities, it may be recognized as being generally accurate, reliable, trustworthy. Without these signals, a text with a similar topical focus might fail to be taken as credible or useful. In this essay we propose to quantify genre signaling based on three measures: (1) stability, (2) frequency, and (3) periodicity."}

Generative AI APIs can be consumed by mobile devices, which are constrained by resources such as CPU, memory, and battery power. Power can be saved by using both Edge and Cloud Computing. However, there is a penalty to response time implementing these services. There seems to be a greater impact on response time with Cloud Computing than with Edge Computing, however Edge Computing is constrained by limits on payload and maximum response times. Our testing results show that Edge Computing is a good middle ground, providing a balance between savings in CPU time, while somewhat mitigating the penalty in response time.

Peer-reviewed research has not yet considered a healthcare crowdsourcing event focusing on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), which generates text in response to detailed prompts and has vast potential for improving the efficiency of healthcare organizations. Our event, the New York University Langone Health (NYULH) Prompt-a-thon, primarily sought to inspire and build AI fluency within our diverse NYULH community, and foster collaboration and innovation. Secondarily, we sought to analyze how participants\u2019 experience was influenced by their prior GenAI exposure and whether they received sample prompts during the workshop. Methods Executing the event required the assembly of an expert planning committee, who recruited diverse participants, anticipated technological challenges, and prepared the event. The event was composed of didactics and workshop sessions, which educated and allowed participants to experiment with using GenAI on real healthcare data. Participants were given novel \u201cproject cards\u201d associated with each dataset that illuminated the tasks GenAI could perform and, for a random set of teams, sample prompts to help them achieve each task (the public repository of project cards can be found at https://github.com/smallw03/NYULH-Generative-AI-Prompt-a-thon-Project-Cards). Afterwards, participants were asked to fill out a survey with 7-point Likert-style questions. Results Our event was successful in educating and inspiring hundreds of enthusiastic in-person and virtual participants across our organization on the responsible use of GenAI in a low-cost and technologically feasible manner. All participants responded positively, on average, to each of the survey questions (e.g., confidence in their ability to use and trust GenAI). Critically, participants reported a self-perceived increase in their likelihood of using and promoting colleagues\u2019 use of GenAI for their daily work. No significant differences were seen in the surveys of those who received sample prompts with their project task descriptions Conclusion The first healthcare Prompt-a-thon was an overwhelming success, with minimal technological failures, positive responses from diverse participants and staff, and evidence of post-event engagement.

Despite growing interest of LLM unlearning, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning method designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent relationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively examined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact with unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types of unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while maintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE boosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as gradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such as fictitious unlearning, malicious use prevention, and copyrighted information removal, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and pinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning. It stands in contrast to previous methods that lack weight attribution and simpler weight attribution techniques."}

By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare."}

Our method interprets time-series data as \\textit{discrete samples from an underlying continuous dynamical system}, and models its time evolution using Neural Stochastic Differential Equation (Neural SDE), where both the flow (drift) and diffusion terms are parameterized by neural networks. We derive a principled maximum likelihood objective and a \\textit{simulation-free} scheme for efficient training of our Neural SDE model. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through experiments on sequence modeling tasks across both embodied and generative AI. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show that SDE-based continuous-time modeling also excels in such complex scenarios, and we hope that our work opens up new avenues for research of SDE models in high-dimensional and temporally intricate domains."}

President Biden\u2019s Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (Executive Order 14110) has generated numerous discussions that may lead to recommendations from government agencies and others tasked with investigating these issues in the United States. For example, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) is assessing the ways in which AI can increase these biosecurity risks and especially pandemic threats. Bringing together scientists from industry and academia, a recent meeting illustrated how generative AI has been used to design proteins, small molecules, CRISPRs, and to showcase the clear potential for AI to aid in innovation. On the other hand, misuse of AI is secondary to the science and most scientists do not consider misuse potential unless they need or must. The meeting discussed several steps that can be taken to add to the security of LLMs that may prevent or slow misuse in addition to their limitations. The general ease with which these generative AI technologies can be used, opens their use to the public, although a college education may be necessary to benefit from and understand their capabilities. At this stage, it is unclear what recommendations will be forthcoming from NASEM or the US government and what impact these will have on the growing AI field."}

In this article, we focus on generating alternate endings for short stories. Although some work has been done on story generation, to the best of our knowledge, very little work has been done on generating alternate endings. For a more precise ending, a large amount of context needs to be provided making story ending generation a more challenging problem than complete story generation. We propose a complete pipeline consisting of text understanding and text generation modules for generating story endings. Within story understanding modules, we propose and integrate various sub-modules to capture the context of the story. This context is combined with the original story during the training and story generation phase for which a T5 transformer is used. Compared to previous studies, our proposed model reports a higher BLEU value. We also conducted a subjective user study to evaluate the endings generated by our model. Machine-generate endings were given an average score of 3.82 (out of 5) as opposed to 3.86 for human-generated endings."}

We propose AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents - a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations - such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering automation."}

AI tools have reshaped scholarly writing by enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and productivity. This study investigated the level of awareness, adoption, challenges, perceived benefits, and effectiveness of AI tools among research scholars from India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), via a structured questionnaire administered to 174 research scholars across various academic disciplines in leading universities. The study identified various generative AI platforms used by scholars and explored key metrics, such as brainstorming, generation of ideas, grammar and style checking, literature discovery, paraphrasing, citation management, and plagiarism detection. The findings revealed a strong positive response related to awareness and adoption rates as well as significant differences based on geographic location, gender, academic discipline, and years of research experience. Despite acknowledging the perceived benefits and effectiveness of AI tools, concerns and challenges related to ethical usage, accuracy and bias, academic integrity, overdependence, and technical difficulties exist. The study provides various recommendations for AI use in academic writing, including the need for AI literacy training, institutional support, and policies related to ethical standards, and offers important implications for academic institutions, AI tools developers, research supervisors, and policy makers, fostering the effective integration of AI in academic research practices, following an ethical framework."}

Although effective under static conditions, dynamic contextual factors, such as weather conditions and geographic location, are frequently overlooked despite their clear influence on consumer behavior. To overcome these limitations, context-aware recommender systems integrate real-time situational data, including ambient temperature, precipitation, and demographic attributes, into the recommendation process, therefore providing more precise and relevant suggestions.An author-developed framework employs OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 variants to produce personalized order recommendations. Upon receiving a user-provided location (e.g., \u201cPula\u201d), current weather data are retrieved from an external API and combined with user profile information to construct contextualized prompts. These prompts are sent directly to the OpenAI API, which returns context-aware recommendations based on the provided inputs.

OOD detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and security of machine learning models deployed in critical applications, such as banking. While several studies have explored OOD detection in various domains such as natural images, genomics, text etc., there is a notable lack of research dedicated to document data in the banking sector. In the banking sector, documents such as letter of credit, invoice, bill of lading, insurance document, airway bill, passports, identity cards etc. are required to be processed. These documents are semantically different from natural images in terms of their composition on high-level and low-level features. Due to this most of the methods which work for natural images may not work or show a different behavior when applied to document datasets. Moreover, there is also no OOD benchmark dataset available in the document domain. To address this gap, in this work, we have curated an in-distribution and out-of-distribution document datasets. On this data we have benchmarked various discriminative and generative approaches to test our hypothesis. From Our experimental results we demonstrate that the generative approaches outperform discriminative approaches by a large margin at OOD task. We have also established that those generative models which factor in high frequency features would perform well for document data."}

Interpreting these findings, we argue for a conceptual extension of time work. We introduce three concepts to account for these emergent practices: the human-AI dyad as a new collaborative agent, emotional and cognitive time work as a technique for processing affective labor, and the co-creative workflow as a setting for sustaining creative momentum.

To address this research gap, we explored how Generative AI could enhance personalized learning interfaces for ADHD students aged 18\u201330 who have experience with online learning. This initiative aims to create an innovative learning platform for ADHD individuals to enhance their motivation and academic success. We employ statistical analysis methods to evaluate three different learning management systems (LMS): a general-purpose LMS, a manually optimized LMS for ADHD users, and an AI-driven LMS with improved prompting features. We evaluated the feedback from 22 ADHD students to assess measures of the usability and effectiveness of each system through the System Usability Scale (SUS), the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), task analysis, and evaluations by UI/UX professionals and HCI experts to gauge learning outcomes and engagement of users. The research discovered that users prefer the AI-generated LMS for usability and the manual system for effectiveness. The findings indicate that although AI-generated user interfaces (UIs) enhance usability, human-designed UIs are essential for educational effectiveness.

While this rightfully raised a host of practical concerns, mostly around cheating, it should also raise questions about what kind of intellectual life the liberal arts will open once they are no longer centered on writing. In this paper, I argue that the automation of writing and the subsequent decentering of writing within the liberal arts is a threat to the liberal arts\u2019 intellectual life. I first argue that technics always participate in the constitution of the intellectual life, and so any transformation in the technical supplement will transform the intellectual life. I then argue that the technical supplement of the liberal arts\u2019 intellectual life is writing. Thus, the decentering of writing transforms and threatens the liberal arts\u2019 intellectual life. Considering this transformation and threat, those of us involved in the liberal arts need to re-examine what type of intellectual life we want to/can live and pass on. It becomes imperative for those of us in the liberal arts to recognize and to respond creatively to this existential crisis."}

In particular, we consider a multi-party situation where the optimizer has access to performance scores computed from the training dataset but does not have access to the dataset itself. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for collaboratively optimizing natural language prompts in distributed, multiparty environments. Our approach extends the recent LLM-based prompt optimizer, Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), by utilizing a synthetic dataset. Unlike existing federated learning-based prompt tuning techniques that only optimize continuous prompts as numerical vectors, our method allows multiple data owners to refine natural language prompts without exposing confidential data. Experiments on the GSM8K benchmark demonstrate task-specific performance improvements using the proposed method. This work provides a secure and practical solution for prompt tuning in privacy-sensitive, distributed settings, advancing the use of LLMs and SLMs in specialized domains."}

This paper describes a proof-of-concept experiment on the applicability of LLMs as a recombination operator for Genetic Improvement (GI). A simple GI search was applied to two faulty Python functions that are generally considered appropriate exercises for beginner programmers. The initial generation of programs was seeded with a set of faulty versions and then GPT-3.5 turbo from OpenAI was used with minimal prompting, as the only recombination operator to generate subsequent generations. Several interesting observations were made that will guide further investigations into the use of LLMs in GI. Key among those was that it seems LLMs will need substantial and highly optimised prompting to be effective standalone GI operators. The LLM did not recognise logic errors but when the search was seeded with syntax errors then the performance was significantly better. An important feature of generative AI that was observed and should be exploited in future work is its ability to synthesise mutations even if the prompt did not ask for them."}

However, the existing empirical data regarding the effectiveness of technologies like ChatGPT as autonomous programming tutors is presently limited. The present study investigates the capacity of ChatGPT to facilitate the acquisition of fundamental programming skills for novice programmers without human assistance. This study puts forth a conceptual framework (APEC - Adaptive Programming Education via ChatGPT) that integrates both bottom-up and top-down approaches, incorporating ChatGPT as the principal instructor for the study of programming. An empirical study was undertaken to assess the usefulness of ChatGPT as a tool for teaching novice programmers a new programming language. This empirical study was conducted on 20 undergraduate students. To provide an expert assessment of the quality of the responses, a survey was conducted with three programming experts proficient in Python. The survey findings indicate that ChatGPT is proficient in explaining core principles such as variables, data types, and control statements through conversational exchanges, adopting an intelligent and logical methodology. Nevertheless, certain constraints arise when dealing with increasingly complex topics."}

Informed human opinion is key to guiding appropriate technological development and task refinement. Detailed data on how GPTs/LLMs powered-Chatbots usage, perceived risks and benefits among physicians has evolved over time and their impact on clinical and academic activities remain unclear. The aim of this study is to assess how the use of GPTs/LLMs chatbots by professionals working in urology has changed over time in the setting of academic and clinical activities.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA one-year follow-up prospective cross-sectional survey was conducted among urology professionals. Results were reported highlighting the differences in baseline characteristics of participants and their responses between the initial release (April 20th, 2023 and May 5th, 2023) and re-deployment of the survey 12 months after chi square and t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 129 participants completed the second survey. Eighty-six percent of participants reported having used any GPTs/LLMs chatbot for academic tasks, a significant increase from the previous survey (52.4%; P<0.001). When asked if they were using GPTs/LLMs chatbots more in academic settings compared to one year prior, 70.1% of participants answered affirmatively. Participants, when asked about the use of GPT/LLMs in particular clinical tasks after one year, reported less frequent use for deciding treatment options (18.6% vs. 31.0%; P=0.03) and patient follow-up care (10.1% vs. 21.4%; P=0.02). When participants were asked if they were using LLM chatbots more in clinical settings compared to one year before, 35.6% answered affirmatively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGPTs/LLMs have a consolidated role in academic tasks, with increasing usage, while some resistance to their use in clinical practice remains. These results are relevant for driving the human-centered development of GenAI technology."}

Results show that participants engaging with GAI therapists exhibiting slow response times and rich content experienced higher happiness, while those interacting with faster, brief-content GAI therapists showed greater surprise. Additionally, despite the stress levels initially slightly rising during conversations with GAI therapists, they decrease over time and ultimately lead to an improved emotional state. These findings validate the effectiveness of GAI therapists and provide a basis for applying GAI in different psychotherapy scenarios."}

Nearly 100 Chinese students from four parallel International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing classes in a university foundation program participated in a 9-week trial, with half assigned to an experimental group and half to a control group. Both groups received theme-based instructions on IELTS Writing Task 2 through a three-stage writing process, while the experimental group also engaged with\n Kimi\n , a widely used GenAI chatbot in China, during and after class. Unlike previous studies, this research targeted lower-intermediate learners and aimed to offer a more nuanced understanding of GenAI\u2019s role by employing natural language processing (NLP)-based evaluations and linear mixed-effect models in the quantitative analysis. The pretest and posttest results showed that GenAI-assisted instruction did not significantly improve students\u2019 writing performance except in syntactic complexity. The questionnaire and interview data, however, indicated that this approach positively influenced learners\u2019 motivation, engagement, and self-efficacy. Further analysis suggested that the discrepancy between students\u2019 improvements in writing performance and their reported affective gains may be attributed to limited learner agency, a lack of teacher support outside class, and misalignment between their English proficiency levels, cognitive readiness, and GenAI\u2019s affordances. The study concludes with implications for second-language writing instruction and directions for future research.\n"}

In many proposals in the literature, these explanations are personalized in that they refer to a user\u2019s known individual preferences. Some recent works, however, also indicate that personalization should also happen at a higher level, where the system, in a first step, decides in which specific way an explanation should be provided, depending, for example, on the user\u2019s expertise. In this research, we take the first steps towards personality-aware explanations by exploring how users perceive explanations tailored to reflect the Big Five personality traits. To this purpose, we leverage the capabilities of modern Generative AI tools to create personality-based explanations at scale in the context of a music recommendation scenario. A linguistic analysis of the generated explanations confirms that they properly reflect expected language patterns associated with individual personality traits. Furthermore, a user study shows that users tend to prefer certain linguistic framings over others, for example, explanations that reflect low-neuroticism patterns. In addition, we find that some explanation forms are more effective than others regarding persuasiveness and perceived overall quality."}

Our participants raised concerns about the opacity of the data used to train Gen AI. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to identify and address inaccurate, biased, and potentially harmful, information generated by these models. Knowledge workers also expressed worries about Gen AI undermining trust in the relationship between instructor and student and discussed potential solutions, such as pedagogy readiness, to mitigate them. Additionally, participants recognized Gen AI's potential to democratize knowledge by accelerating the learning process and act as an accessible research assistant. However, there were also concerns about potential social and power imbalances stemming from unequal access to such technologies.

Recently, with the incorporation of generative AI, the power and accuracy of computational protein structure prediction/design have been improved significantly. However, ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation (biosecurity) pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures. As a proof of concept, we propose a two-stage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models. FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder, which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed user-specific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure. In the second step, protein generative models are fine-tuned with watermark-conditioned Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source protein structure prediction models (e.g., ESMFold and MultiFlow) and de novo structure design models (e.g., FrameDiff and FoldFlow) and we demonstrate that our method is effective across all these generative models. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original protein structure quality and is robust under potential post-processing and adaptive attacks."}

Evidence demonstrates that AI chatbots can assist with tasks such as documentation, research, counseling, and therapeutic exercises. However, research examining practitioners\u2019 perspectives is limited. Objective This mixed-methods study investigates: (1) practitioners\u2019 perspectives on different uses of generative AI chatbots; (2) their likelihood of recommending chatbots to clients; and (3) whether recommendation likelihood increases after viewing a demonstration. Methods Participants were 23 mental health practitioners, including 17 females and 6 males, with a mean age of 39.39 (SD 16.20) years. In 45-minute interviews, participants selected their 3 most helpful uses of chatbots from 11 options and rated their likelihood of recommending chatbots to clients on a Likert scale before and after an 11-minute chatbot demonstration. Results Binomial tests found that Generating case notes was selected at greater-than-chance levels ( 15/23, 65%; P=.001), while Support with session planning (P=.86) and Identifying and suggesting literature (P=.10) were not. Although 55% (12/23) were likely to recommend chatbots to clients, a binomial test found no significant difference from the 50% threshold (P=.74). A paired samples t test found that recommendation likelihood increased significantly (19/23, 83%; P=.002) from predemonstration to postdemonstration. Conclusions Findings suggest practitioners favor administrative uses of generative AI and are more likely to recommend chatbots to clients after exposure. This study highlights a need for practitioner education and guidelines to support safe and effective AI integration in mental health care."}

Traditional optimization techniques rely on computationally expensive simulations and iterative solvers, which pose significant challenges in terms of time and resource consumption. In this study, we propose a novel Generative AI-driven aerodynamic shape optimization framework that leverages deep neural networks to streamline the optimization process. Our approach integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate and refine aerodynamic shapes with optimal performance metrics. By training the neural network on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets, we enable the model to predict optimal aerodynamic shapes with reduced computational overhead. The proposed framework incorporates physics-informed machine learning techniques, ensuring adherence to fluid dynamics principles while significantly accelerating the optimization process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to benchmark aerodynamic cases, including airfoil and automotive body designs, where the AI-driven optimization leads to a substantial reduction in drag and improved lift-to-drag ratios. Comparative analysis against traditional evolutionary algorithms and adjoint-based solvers highlights the superior efficiency and accuracy of our method. Our findings underscore the potential of generative AI in revolutionizing aerodynamic design, making it more accessible, cost-effective, and adaptable to real-time optimization scenarios. The study paves the way for integrating AI-driven techniques in future aerodynamic modeling, enabling rapid prototyping and enhanced engineering solutions for various high-performance applications."}

Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected using an online questionnaire from 462 EFL students at three private universities in Indonesia and analyzed with the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 4. The results indicated that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, autonomy, and relatedness significantly impacted EFL students\u2019 intention to adopt GenAI for English learning. While competence did not significantly influence behavioral intention, both the SDT components (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and behavioral intention were predictors of actual usage. The integrated framework explained a high proportion of variance (R\u00b2 = 83.1% for behavioral intention; R\u00b2 = 77.1% for actual use).

The popularity and breadth of use also put this technology in the position to fundamentally reshape how written language is perceived and evaluated. It is also the case that spoken language has long played a role in maintaining power and hegemony in society, especially through ideas of social identity and \u201ccorrect\u201d forms of language. But as human communication becomes even more reliant on text and writing, it is important to understand how these processes might shift and who is more likely to see their writing styles reflected back at them through modern AI. We therefore ask the following question: who does generative AI write like? To answer this, we compare writing style features in over 150,000 college admissions essays submitted to a large public university system and an engineering program at an elite private university with a corpus of over 25,000 essays generated with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to the same writing prompts. We find that human-authored essays exhibit more variability across various individual writing style features (e.g., verb usage) than AI-generated essays. Overall, we find that the AI-generated essays are most similar to essays authored by students who are males with higher levels of social privilege. These findings demonstrate critical misalignments between human and AI authorship characteristics, which may affect the evaluation of writing and calls for research on control strategies to improve alignment."}

Theoretical framing employs a double-edged effect approach, and this implies that there are both positives and negative outcomes of the same personalization processes. The research solely employs secondary data, as it combines anonymized FinTech marketing logs, natural-experiment rollout logs, and open-access controlled experiment repositories to mediate by personalization and moderate by transparency. The methods of analysis are descriptive statistics, difference-in-means, linear probability model, difference-in-differences, heterogeneity test and mediation analysis. The initial anticipations are that AI-personalized messages increase aggregate conversion and engagement, however, more significantly they increase subgroup differences and privacy or complaint indicators where there is low transparency which is synonymous with existing findings on usefulness, bias, and cyber risks. To inform policy, the paper proposes governance measures such as transparency labels, fairness audits, and mandatory reporting of parity gaps, practical steps to balance innovation and consumer protection."}

With the popularity of ChatGPT, the trend of human-AI collaboration through LLM based chatbots is growing, reaching an ever-expanding audience. A key group that requires special attention is children. A chatbot designed for children should be both knowledgeable and empathetic. While chatbots are essentially fine-tuned versions of LLMs, fine-tuning these models for this specific purpose presents a challenge due to the lack of readily available datasets that address both scientific queries and empathetic situations. This data shortage can be addressed by using generative AI techniques to create synthetic dataset samples. As such, we propose in this paper the use of ChatGPT prompting to generate the Sahar Dataset, a multi-turn student-centric chatbot interaction dataset that supports both STEAM and empathetic related dialogues. Our results show that the Sahar dataset is readable by 5th grade students according to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade score, while other popular datasets like Alpaca require a 9th grade reading level. Moreover, we obtained an IRB for human evaluations, and the results show that 90 percent of the dataset's STEAM is factual, and the empathetic dialogues lead to valid solutions to the child's problem 90 percent of the time."}

These metrics are primarily designed to evaluate machine translation and classification of tasks, but they fail to capture the evolving intent alignment, conversational complexity, emotional nuance, and dynamic user interaction patterns that are commonly found in present day's generative AI-powered chatbot systems. Through this paper, while we are critically examining the shortcomings of single-metric evaluations, we also introduce a robust and comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework that perfectly suits the contemporary chatbot architectures. Bridging theory and deployment together, our evaluation model incorporates findings from academic research, industry case studies, and hands-on experiments to assess coherence, contextual understanding, goal accuracy, safety compliance, and user satisfaction. By integrating both automatic and human-centric metrics, we subsequently outline a modular evaluation suite. This framework is applied across enterprise-level and open-domain chatbots, and demonstrated improved diagnostic capabilities over traditional methods.

The review draws on the OpenAlex publication database, using a Boolean search approach to identify scientific literature related to GenAI (including large language models and ChatGPT). Thirty-nine highly cited papers and commentaries are reviewed and qualitatively coded. Results are categorized by GenAI applications in science, scientific writing, medical practice, and education and training. The analysis finds that while there is a rapid adoption of GenAI in science and science practice, its long-term implications remain unclear, with ongoing uncertainties about its use and governance. The study provides early insights into GenAI's growing role in science and identifies questions for future research in this evolving field."}

Research design and methods: PLS were generated from two different manuscripts using 18 generative AI platforms (free and paid), including general, document-specific, and science-specific platforms. All PLS underwent initial technical assessment and were scored for content relevance, accuracy and reading level. The stakeholder review then reviewed the six highest scoring PLS, using a Likert scale to rate each for understandability, ease of reading, content inclusion and utility, and ranking the PLS in order of preference. Results: An overview of technical assessments is shown in Table 1. Stakeholder assessments and rankings of the different platforms are presented. Conclusions: AI-generated PLS were generally accurate but not necessarily complete or appropriate in the language used. AI appeared to perform well when extracting key themes and producing broad topline summaries, but many failed to extract specific data, hence avoiding inaccuracy through exclusion. If more detailed, complete and appropriate PLS are to be produced, improvements to the AI platform would be required."}

This study employed a systematic literature review method conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework and aligned with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Articles were sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, limited to publications from 2020 to March 2025. Data were analyzed through qualitative thematic analysis, with contextual analysis applied where relevant to infer missing or ambiguous details in the source articles. Of 182 articles identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. The review revealed four main AI applications: predictive analytics for risk identification, decision support systems (DSS) for evidence-based practice, AI-powered simulations for clinical training, and generative AI tools like ChatGPT for fostering critical thinking and digital literacy. Despite these advancements, challenges such as ethical concerns (algorithmic bias, privacy issues), poor data quality, limited AI expertise among educators, and resistance to change in traditional learning environments were noted. AI has the potential to transform midwifery education, but overcoming technical, ethical, and pedagogical barriers is essential for its successful integration. Enhancing faculty capacity, ensuring data integrity, and incorporating AI literacy into curricula are vital steps toward sustainable implementation."}

Our approach leverages a hybrid neural architecture integrating YOLO-based logo detection with Large Mask (LaMa) inpainting, enhanced by a proprietary layer masking system. The framework employs a cascaded pipeline beginning with precise logo detection using a confidence threshold of 0.6, validated through extensive experimentation on the OpenLogo dataset. Multi-layer masking is used to prevent the information loss on nontargeted region of the inpainting through a combination of magenta and white pixel masking layers. Our method significantly reduces computational overhead through efficient frame buffer management and asynchronous processing, making it suitable for fast execution and video creation. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in video logo removal but also provides insights into effective combining detection and inpainting architectures for complex video processing tasks."}

The use of the same or similar AI models appears to lead to more homogeneous behavior. Our work begins with the observation that there is a force pushing in the opposite direction: compe- tition. When producers compete with one another (e.g., for customers or attention), they are incentivized to create novel or unique content. We explore the impact com- petition has on both content diversity and overall social welfare. Through a formal game-theoretic model, we show that competitive markets select for diverse AI models, mitigating monoculture. We further show that a generative AI model that performs well in isolation (i.e., according to a benchmark) may fail to provide value in a compet- itive market. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating generative AI models across the breadth of their output distributions, particularly when they will be deployed in competitive environments. We validate our results empirically by using language models to play Scattergories, a word game in which players are rewarded for answers that are both correct and unique. Overall, our results suggest that homogenization due to generative AI is unlikely to persist in competitive markets, and instead, competition in downstream markets may drive diversification in AI model development"}

Fast advances in the area of Artificial Intelligence have produced large language models that can perform a variety of tasks, including generating text summaries and reports. In this article, we study the potential black-box use of LLM chatbots as a support tool for security analysts.

This paper presents a novel generative AI system for text classification, summarization and response generation of consumer communications. The system uses the same foundation model and a uniform pipeline for the tasks proposed. Consumer communications are massive and served mainly via voice and text, and until recently could be handled only with human agents (customer service representatives). However, they must be handled with quality, consistency, speed and low cost, at scale. We limit our attention to financial consumer communications from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), publicly available in a dataset of over 4.7 million complaints. Performance reaches 88 % accuracy (without fine-tuning) for classification and over 72 % for summarization and response generation. Artificial intelligence has great positive impacts for business and society, but its application and deployment also poses risks and unknowns. We thus address the important questions of risk, bias, interpretability, explainability, safety and regulatory compliance with the emerging legal frameworks."}

While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling, I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical plausibility compared to existing approaches."}

This study focuses on developing and evaluating encoder-decoder architectures for the American Sign Language (ASL) image dataset, consisting of 87,000 images across 29 hand sign classes. Three approaches were compared: Feedforward Autoencoders, Convolutional Autoencoders, and Diffusion Autoencoders. The Diffusion Autoencoder outperformed the others, achieving the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and highest Mean Opinion Score (MOS) due to its probabilistic noise modeling and iterative denoising capabilities. The Convolutional Autoencoder demonstrated effective spatial feature extraction but lacked the robustness of the diffusion process, while the Feedforward Autoencoder served as a baseline with limitations in handling complex image data. Objective and subjective evaluations confirmed the superiority of the Diffusion Autoencoder for high-fidelity image reconstruction, emphasizing its potential in multimodal AI applications such as sign language recognition and generation. This work provides critical insights into designing robust encoder-decoder systems to advance multimodal AI capabilities."}

The protocol integrates principles from internal consistency models for knowledge in ancient Indian philosophy (\u201cMimamsa\u201d or Exegesis) and Socratic questioning to encourage a collaborative, iterative dialogue between human users and GenAI, positioning the GenAI as an \u201conline external consultant\u201d and maintaining the human \u201cin-the-loop\u201d for oversight, contextualization, and critical evaluation. The efficacy of the protocol was empirically evaluated through two scenarios - in Scenario 1 three homeowners sought fire-mitigation strategies for three Southern California properties within a $50 K budget, and in Scenario 2 a business analyst aimed for a knowledge graph\u2013based strategic model for a lubricant manufacturer. Compared to generic prompting, the Mimansa-guided interactions in both the scenarios yielded more substantive, context specific outputs that were validated by experts in the domains, and accelerated user learning of domain relevant concepts. The findings demonstrate that the proposed Mimansa protocol significantly enhances GenAI performance by structuring human\u2013GenAI collaboration, ensuring transparency, and capturing mutual learning in actionable artifacts like knowledge graphs in a very short time. Consistent uses of the proposed Mimansa protocol by each level of executives in an organization can, over time, build up the five key pre-requisites required to have a learning organization\u2014personal mastery, mental models, shared vision, team learning, and systems thinking\u2014transforming GenAI from a mere tool into a co creative partner, fostering organizational learning and strategic advantage."}

This alarming trend often goes unnoticed by instructors, as many do not actively monitor for such misconduct. However, the onset of the pandemic saw a surge in cheating incidents, mainly due to the shift to online learning environments where supervision was more challenging. Despite this, instances of cheating remained detectable, albeit with some effort. As we transition out of the pandemic era, a new challenge has emerged in the form of generative AI technology, which has dramatically altered the landscape of academic dishonesty. With the advent of sophisticated generative AI models, it has become virtually impossible to discern between authentic student work and AI-generated content in unsupervised settings. Consequently, there has been a noticeable decline in detected cheating cases compared to pre-pandemic levels, largely attributed to the widespread use of generative AI tools. Traditional plagiarism detection software such as Turnitin and MOSS, once considered reliable safeguards against academic dishonesty, have become obsolete in the face of these advanced AI systems. The unique solutions produced by generative AI render such detection methods ineffective, posing a significant challenge to maintaining academic integrity in the modern educational landscape. This paper explores the nature of academic misconduct incidents in the context of two universities across the globe: one in the United Kingdom and the other in New Zealand."}

The identified limitation is assessed from the perspective of the \u2018essence\u2019 of the right to the protection of personal data. With the further aim of assessing the limitation, the author explores whether the right to be forgotten (RTBF) is relevant or effective in an AI/machine learning context. These considerations are focused on the technical problems encountered when applying the strict interpretation of the RTBF. In particular, the antagonism between, on the one hand, the values of privacy and data protection rights, and on the other, the technical capabilities of the producer of the generative AI models, is further analysed in this context. As the conclusion emphasizes that the RTBF cannot be practicably or effectively exercised in the machine learning models, further considerations of this exposed limitation are presented. The proportionality principle, as an instrument that supports the proper application if there is any limitation of the conflicting rights, has been utilized to depict the qualitative approach. The integration of this principle supports the conclusion by identifying a more efficient way to address some regulatory issues. Hence, the conclusion of the article presents some suggested solutions as to the interpretation of this right in the light of this new technological advancement. Ultimately, the paper aims to address the legal conundrum of how to balance the conflict between the interest of innovative use of the data (the data producer\u2019s right) and privacy and data protection rights."}

However, this fast development has prompted increased scrutiny concerning user privacy and the use of copyrighted works in training. A recent attack on machine-learning models called membership inference lies at the crossroads of these two concerns. The attack is given as input a set of records and a trained model and seeks to identify which of those records may have been used to train the model. On one hand, this attack can be used to identify user data used to train a model, which may violate their privacy especially in sensitive applications such as models trained on medical data. On the other hand, this attack can be used by rights-holders as evidence that a company used their works without permission to train a model. Remarkably, it appears that no work has studied the effect of membership inference attacks (MIA) on generative music. Given that the music industry is worth billions of dollars and artists would stand to gain from being able to determine if their works were being used without permission, we believe this is a pressing issue to study. As such, in this work we begin a preliminary study into whether MIAs are effective on generative music. We study the effect of several existing attacks on MuseGAN, a popular and influential generative music model. Similar to prior work on generative audio MIAs, our findings suggest that music data is fairly resilient to known membership inference techniques."}

With the rise of AI generators in social media and pop culture, these problems amplify as the demand for AI tools skyrockets. These solutions regularly exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes deeply embedded in the data developers use to train AI models. Perhaps exacerbating the immediacy of the issue, generative AI models can create highly realistic imagery, empowering users with malicious intent. This paper explores the pervasive issue of bias in generative AI and its implications. It also examines how these models, often trained on biased datasets, can unintentionally amplify, replicate, and reinforce harmful biases and stereotypes. Additionally, it delves into the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and in a novel study, discusses how a popular TikTok filter that uses generative AI exhibits gender and racial biases while excessively sexualizing its users. While research on AI bias is forthcoming, existing literature referenced throughout this paper underscores its presence across various systems. This paper demonstrates the continued propagation of AI bias as these systems expand and iterate, often with inadequate mitigation efforts. It advocates for ethical considerations, accountability, and transparency in generative AI design and data selection. The Author proposes a novel framework called the Stereotypes, Objectification, Racism, and Datasets (SORD) Framework. The SORD Framework is proposed as a lens to examine the multifaceted dimensions of bias in generative AI. By critically analyzing these components, this paper aims to shed light on the ethical implications of biased generative AI, stimulate thoughtful discussions regarding responsible AI development, and provoke the lengthy process of removing bias from the systems and training datasets to eliminate AI bias at the source. Furthermore, it calls for collaboration among developers, researchers, and engineers to advance research, mitigate biases, and promote algorithmic fairness using the SORD Framework. Future work includes refining the SORD framework and assessing its effectiveness. Lastly, the Author underscores the pivotal role of engineering education in nurturing ethical AI practices, empowering future engineers to address societal challenges stemming from biased datasets and AI systems."}

This study contributes to the debate by presenting cross-country experimental data (n = 150; Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom) on how individuals engage with generative AI under different conditions: human-only, human + AI (unguided), human + AI (guided with structured prompting), and AI-only benchmarks. Across 450 evaluated responses, critical reasoning was assessed via expert rubric ratings, while perceived reflective engagement was captured through self-report indices. Results show that unguided AI use fosters cognitive offloading without improving reasoning quality, whereas structured prompting significantly reduces offloading and enhances both critical reasoning and reflective engagement. Mediation and latent class analyses reveal that guided AI use supports deeper human involvement and mitigates demographic disparities in performance. Beyond theoretical contributions, this study offers practical implications for business and society. As organisations integrate AI into workflows, unstructured use risks undermining workforce decision making and critical engagement. Structured prompting, by contrast, provides a scalable and low-cost governance tool that fosters responsible adoption, supports equitable access to technological benefits, and aligns with societal calls for human-centric AI. These findings highlight the dual nature of AI as both a productivity enabler and a cognitive risk, and position structured prompting as a promising intervention to navigate the emerging challenges of AI adoption in business and society."}

In this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of 110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13 openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable.

Various techniques have been introduced for identifying AI-generated images, with watermarking emerging as a promising approach. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of various AI-image detectors including watermarking and classifier-based deepfake detectors. For watermarking methods that introduce subtle image perturbations (i.e., low perturbation budget methods), we reveal a fundamental trade-off between the evasion error rate (i.e., the fraction of watermarked images detected as non-watermarked ones) and the spoofing error rate (i.e., the fraction of non-watermarked images detected as watermarked ones) upon an application of diffusion purification attack. To validate our theoretical findings, we also provide empirical evidence demonstrating that diffusion purification effectively removes low perturbation budget watermarks by applying minimal changes to images. The diffusion purification attack is ineffective for high perturbation watermarking methods where notable changes are applied to images. In this case, we develop a model substitution adversarial attack that can successfully remove watermarks. Moreover, we show that watermarking methods are vulnerable to spoofing attacks where the attacker aims to have real images identified as watermarked ones, damaging the reputation of the developers. In particular, with black-box access to the watermarking method, a watermarked noise image can be generated and added to real images, causing them to be incorrectly classified as watermarked. Finally, we extend our theory to characterize a fundamental trade-off between the robustness and reliability of classifier-based deep fake detectors and demonstrate it through experiments."}

Current methods are prone to problems like high false positive rates, shallow contextual understanding, and sluggish reaction times, which can lead to financial losses, reputations, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. While some work has been conducted on the application of machine learning and natural language processing for security analysis, these efforts are mostly in silos and lack a coherent framework that dynamically responds to new threat intelligence. To address this gap in research, this work presents SHIELDRAG (Security-Hardened, Integrated, Explainable, and Learning-Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a new generative AI system specifically tailored for proactive threat detection in financial environments. As the opposite of conventional detection systems, SHIELD-RAG combines the strengths of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with domain-aware embeddings and an ever-evolving security knowledge base, enabling real-time threat prediction, contextual alerting, and remediation insights. Through retrieval of pertinent threat intelligence information and generation of explainable narratives on suspicious patterns, the model enhances situational awareness and provides analysts with greater accuracy and timeliness in decision-making abilities. The proposed methodology not only addresses the critical challenge of explainability in AI-based threat detection but also bridges the gap between static monitoring as well as adaptive learning. Initial simulations and dataset testing demonstrate dramatic improvement in detection accuracy, interpretability, and response times over current benchmarks. This work positions SHIELD-RAG as a paradigm-shifting financial cybersecurity innovation with implications for broader applications to regulated industries requiring real-time, reliable, and intelligent threat reaction systems."}

This is largely due to wide-scale availability of various generative AI systems that can take in natural language inputs and generate highly customized natural language text, images, audio, and videos. This transformation in how people seek and access information will have profound impacts on users, developers, and policymakers. It is already changing many sectors including education, health, and commerce. But the hopes and hypes of generative AI are often not clear as we get swept up by either the current capabilities and limitations of this technology in the short term or fear from speculative future in the long term. Instead, I believe we need to approach this area pragmatically and with scientific curiosity, scholarly rigor, and societal responsibility. In this talk, I will highlight some of the opportunities and challenges for information access stemming from recent advancements in generative AI. For instance, there are new possibilities now for addressing accessibility, low-resource domains, and bias in training data using generative AI tools. On the other hand, there are new challenges concerning hallucination, toxicity, and information provenance. It is clear that we want to benefit from what AI systems are capable of, but how do we do that while curbing some of these problems? I will argue that the solution is multifaceted and complex -- some will require technical advancements and others will call for policy changes. We will need to not only build information systems with fairness, transparency, and accountability in mind, but also train a new generation of developers, policymakers, and of course the users. The goal here is to cut through both hype and fear and think pragmatically about the future of information access."}

AI is evolving rapidly day by day, including in the field of education. The use of generative AI images and videos, ChatGPT and open educational resources (OER) to create digital vocational training courses in Kenya is explored. Twenty vocational courses were developed to improve education quality, raising awareness of human rights, health, water, wildlife conservation etc., and especially of providing people in rural areas with the necessary knowledge and skills to generate income. The courses are easy to scale up thanks to the ease of changing text, content, avatars, language, subtitles, etc., to be context-relevant. This paper recommends the use of generative AI and OERs as an approach to reform content development which is a cost-effective way of improving students\u2019 vocational skills in Global South. Additionally, this concept paper explores two different systems for students to access the digital vocational training content: mobile technology with the internet and a solar-powered tablet with offline content.

We posit that overemphasizing either aspect can lead to limitations such as hallucinations and memorization. Hallucinations, characterized by AI responses containing random inaccuracies or falsehoods, emerge when models prioritize novelty over usefulness. Memorization, where AI models reproduce content from their training data, results from an excessive focus on usefulness, potentially limiting creativity. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that includes domain-specific analysis, data and transfer learning, user preferences and customization, custom evaluation metrics, and collaboration mechanisms. Our approach aims to generate content that is both novel and useful within specific domains, while considering the unique requirements of various contexts."}

Future research should adopt longitudinal, interdisciplinary, and culturally adaptive frameworks to examine AI's long-term and sustainable impact on language acquisition in varied educational settings."}

Advanced packaging enabling the heterogeneous integration of chiplets offers a promising path to meeting these demands through much more tightly integrated compute and memory units. I will discuss three specific areas in which advanced packaging fueled by advances in materials innovation can benefit AI workloads. First, advanced 2.5D substrates supporting large body sizes and ultra-fine design rules play an instrumental role in increasing compute density and bandwidths with lower latency and power. Organic RDL-based substrates and embedded local-interconnect bridges offer scalable and cost-efficient options to silicon interposers. Second, 3D stacking is an attractive approach for compute-near-memory approaches which significantly lower data movement energy costs and achieve highly compact form factors. The continued scaling of 3D integration will build on advances in hybrid bonding and TSV technologies. The tradeoffs of various approaches - such as chip-to-chip, chip-to-wafer, wafer-to-wafer, along with face-to-face and face-to back - are explored and analyzed. Third, co-packaged optics offers high potential for scale-out to very large systems requiring very high node-to-node bandwidths. A notable advance in this area is IBM\u2019s recent announcement of the world\u2019s first successful polymer optical waveguide to bring the speed and bandwidth of optics on package, to the edge of chips. I will illustrate the benefits of these technologies with example applications in enterprise computing (such as Large Language Models) and edge computing (such as for mmWave)."}

Identifying and comprehending the important aspects influencing instructors' generative AI application skill is a necessary prerequisite for encouraging the innovative development of open education. In this study, the Delphi method was used to identify the factors influencing open university teachers' generative AI application ability, and the Decision Laboratory Analysis Method (DEMATL) was used to classify the factors in terms of causality and rank their importance, resulting in long-term, short-term, and key practices to improve open university teachers' generative AI application ability by combining the cause factor, result factor, and centrality. The research findings can also serve as a scientific foundation for other universities to encourage the use of generative AI in education."}

Existing detection approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy (DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI."}

This study complements prior work by collecting qualitative data from individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild to moderate dementia, uncovering their perspectives, envisioned use cases, and anticipated challenges with generative AI applications. Findings uncover ways people with MCI and dementia want to use AI to engage in resilience building activities related to fostering wellness, building social connections, and finding purpose. Though each of these use cases came with trade-offs in embracing healthy thinking. Based on these findings, we discuss directions for future work in AI for resilience building in dementia. We intend for this work to lay the groundwork for future research in AI design and development to empower people living with dementia to engage in resilience building activities, which may have lasting positive impacts on their mental health and well-being."}

The era of large-scale use of new AI technologies is coming. Now generative AI is a new resource in the economy of the XXI century, the value of which is growing every day. The aim of the paper is to show how generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT, for example, can serve as a new context for the theories and concepts of business management and socioeconomic development. We argue that generative AI as a new technology can affect management work at the strategic, functional and administrative levels. The article provides analysis in the areas of decision making, knowledge management, customer service, human resource management, and explains what may change after the introduction of generative AI. It also provides information on the functions of generative AI, which are useful for understanding and overcoming how new technologies can change organizations. It is proven how generative AI can be used for both optimization and procedural rationality, especially in the field of customer service and deciding whether to solve a problem using technology or humans. Some conclusions are formulated for further research."}

Rather than focusing on individual organisations, this study examines GenAI integration within enterprise platforms, which are extensively adopted by many organisations and thus amplify both the benefits and risks of GenAI. We offer targeted recommendations for enterprise platform owners and their complementors, addressing challenges they face when integrating GenAI into these platforms. Drawing on a case study of Salesforce's experience, we recommend actions in three foundational areas \u2013 platform capability, architecture and governance \u2013 ensuring that our guidance is broadly applicable across enterprise platforms. In platform capability, we advise developing a unified GenAI stack built on existing platform services, offering generic and industry\u2010specific GenAI use cases to accelerate customer adoption and providing tools for customisation and creation of new use cases to enhance GenAI's transformational impact. For platform architecture, we recommend adding new layers for accommodating diverse GenAI foundation models and creating a trusted environment for secure data access, privacy and content monitoring. We also recommend implementing a prompt architecture to improve content relevance and accuracy. In platform governance, we recommend establishing new mechanisms to mitigate GenAI risks. Partnerships with GenAI providers and proactive investments in GenAI are essential to retain critical GenAI technologies. Personalised consultancy and training along with joint design and implementation with platform customers are also recommended. These combined actions, pursued in parallel across capability, architecture and governance, form a sustainable roadmap for GenAI integration in enterprise platforms."}

This framework leverages current work on Earth observation tools, including the Open Data Cube (ODC) [1] and the OEA Algorithm Hub (AlgoHub). [2]In our work, we investigate the ability of large language models to orchestrate and reason with tools created to access geospatial data using the Open Data Cube and the OEA Algorithm Hub [2]. In this paper we propose a natural language analytical framework for orchestrating Earth observation (EO) analysis. The framework uses large language models to interpret an analysis request, devise a solution based on ODC and AlgoHub tools, and execute the analysis. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that an LLM, with its embedded contextual knowledge, can effectively discern and sequence the necessary processing steps required to fulfill Earth observation analysis requests. This research demonstrates the potential of Generative AI (LLMs) in streamlining and enhancing EO analyses and empowering the observation community.In summary, Generative AI (LLMs) can enhance the capabilities of Earth observation analysis by automating tasks, providing natural language interfaces, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the vast and complex datasets generated by remote sensing and EO technologies."}

In this study, a survey of 401 students from major U.S. universities provides insight into how beliefs, behaviors, and policy awareness intersect in shaping how students interact with AI-assisted writing. The findings indicate that students\u2019 ethical beliefs\u2014not institutional policies\u2014are the strongest predictors of perceived misconduct and actual AI use in writing. Policy awareness was found to have no significant effect on ethical judgments or behavior. Instead, students who believe AI writing is cheating were found to be substantially less likely to view it as ethical or engage with it. These findings suggest that many students do not treat AI use in learning activities as an extension of conventional cheating (e.g., plagiarism), but rather as a distinct category of academic conduct/misconduct. Rather than using punitive models to attempt to punish students for using AI, this study suggests that education about AI ethics and the risk of AI overreliance may prove more successful for curbing unethical AI use in higher education."}

At this point, drug discovery has been one of the most remarkable fields where DL has been used in especially last few years. In the context of drug discovery studies, drug repurposing has a unique place to enable known drugs to be used for different diseases. As this is a remarkable way of optimizing discovery and treatment phases, use of DL for drug repurposing applications has still open areas to go. Objective of this paper is to examine the potential of combined DL models for improving drug repurposing and introduce a solution methodology, which includes use of multiple DL models to build a decision support system.

A critical aspect of realizing this potential is allowing players and developers to provide dynamic or free-form text to drive generation. Ingesting free-form text for a video game poses challenges, however, as it can prompt the LLM to generate content beyond the intended narrative scope. In response to this challenge, this research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA) for leveraging LLMs to create narrative content for turn-based, role-playing games (RPGs). PANGeA is an approach comprised of components including a memory system, validation system, a Unity game engine plug-in, and a server with a RESTful interface that enables connecting PANGeA components with any game engine as well as accessing local and private LLMs. PANGeA procedurally generates level data like setting, key items, non-playable characters (NPCs)), and dialogue based on a set of configuration and design rules provided by the game designer. This process is supported by a novel validation system for handling free-form text input during game development and gameplay, which aligns LLM generation with the narrative. It does this by evoking the LLM's capabilities to dynamically evaluate the text input against game rules that reinforce the designer's initial criteria. To enrich player-NPC interactions, PANGeA uses the Big Five Personality model to shape NPC responses. To explore its broad application, PANGeA is evaluated across two studies. First, this research presents a narrative test scenario of the prototype game, Dark Shadows, which was developed using PANGeA within the Unity game engine. This is followed by an ablation study that tests PANGeA's performance across 10 different role-playing game scenarios\u2013from western to science fiction\u2013and across three model sizes: Llama-3 (8B), GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. These evaluations demonstrate that PANGeA's NPCs can hold dynamic, narrative-consistent conversations that, without the memory system, would exceed the LLM's context length. In addition, the results demonstrate PANGeA's validation system not only aligns LLM responses with the game narrative but also improves the performance of Llama-3 (8B), enabling it to perform comparably to large-scale foundational models like GPT-4. With the validation system, Llama-3 (8B)'s performance improved from 28% accuracy to 98%, and GPT-4's from 71% to 99%. These findings indicate PANGeA can help game designers generate narrative-consistent content while leveraging LLMs of different sizes, suitable for various devices."}

For discriminative models, we examine various architectures and hyperparameters during training and inference and identify energy-efficient practices. For generative AI, large language models (LLMs) are assessed, with a focus primarily on energy consumption across different model sizes and varying service requests. Our study employs software-based power measurements, ensuring ease of replication across diverse configurations, models, and datasets. We analyse multiple models and hardware setups to uncover correlations among various metrics, identifying key contributors to energy consumption. The results indicate that, for discriminative models, optimising architectures, hyperparameters, and hardware can significantly reduce energy consumption without sacrificing performance. For LLMs, energy efficiency depends on balancing model size, reasoning complexity, and request-handling capacity, as larger models do not necessarily consume more energy when utilisation remains low. This analysis provides practical guidelines for designing green and sustainable ML operations, emphasising energy consumption and carbon-footprint reductions while maintaining performance. This paper can serve as a benchmark for accurately estimating total energy use across different types of AI models."}

In addition to conducting various disaster\n drills, rescue teams are trained to perform casualty triage in simulated\n scenarios, allowing medical personnel to provide optimal treatment based on\n triage classifications. Due to the necessity of adapting disaster scenarios\n to enable responders to handle diverse disaster sites, each scenario must be\n interactive, helping rescuers understand how to perform triage effectively\n during disaster response. To enrich the variety of scenarios, AI can now be\n utilized for scenario design. However, for more rational script creation,\n generative AI must be grounded in Explainable AI (XAI) to make the\n generation process transparent, thus enhancing the scenario?s realism. This\n paper proposes an XAI-based disaster casualty triage scenario system. The\n system generates scenarios through generative AI, utilizing XAI to ensure\n data transparency. The primary output is a simulation training game focused\n on disaster scenarios, developed on the Unity platform to build realistic\n accident scenes. The goal is to provide frontline firefighters with\n immersive training to strengthen their on-site response and emergency\n handling skills. The game incorporates a triage mechanism that guides users\n to categorize injuries based on symptoms and apply appropriate medical\n actions, aiming to minimize casualties during disasters. From an educational\n perspective, this game provides the general public with an understanding of\n how firefighters perform triage based on injury symptoms in emergencies,\n ensuring that each casualty receives necessary medical support within the\n golden rescue window.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a generative AI-based application, on a wide range of assessments used in contemporary healthcare education and discusses the implications for undergraduate dental education.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis was an exploratory study investigating the accuracy of ChatGPT to attempt a range of recognised assessments in healthcare education curricula. A total of 50 independent items encompassing 50 different learning outcomes (n\u2009=\u200910 per item) were developed by the research team. These included 10 separate items based on each of the five commonly used question formats including multiple-choice questions (MCQs); short-answer questions (SAQs); short essay questions (SEQs); single true/false questions; and fill in the blanks items. Chat GPT was used to attempt each of these 50 questions. In addition, ChatGPT was used to generate reflective reports based on multisource feedback; research methodology; and critical appraisal of the literature.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChatGPT application provided accurate responses to majority of knowledge-based assessments based on MCQs, SAQs, SEQs, true/false and fill in the blanks items. However, it was only able to answer text-based questions and did not allow processing of questions based on images. Responses generated to written assignments were also satisfactory apart from those for critical appraisal of literature. Word count was the key limitation observed in outputs generated by the free version of ChatGPT.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNotwithstanding their current limitations, generative AI-based applications have the potential to revolutionise virtual learning. Instead of treating it as a threat, healthcare educators need to adapt teaching and assessments in medical and dental education to the benefits of the learners while mitigating against dishonest use of AI-based technology."}

By Foundation Model (FM), we mean a model pre-trained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling and forecasting on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications.

The aim is based on the idea of using generative AI art systems as a method. Data visualization is an important part of understanding the evolution of the world around us. It offers the ability to see a representation that goes beyond numbers. Generative AI systems have gained the possibility of helping the process of visualizing data in new ways. This specific process includes real-time-generated artistic renderings of these data. This real-time rendering falls into the field of brainwave visualization, with the help of the EEG (electroencephalogram), which can serve here as input data for Generative AI systems. The brainwave measurement technology as a form of input to real-time generative AI systems represents a novel intersection of neuroscience and art in the field of neurofeedback art.

Using Claude Opus 4.1, we generated Steam Generator Tube Rupture scenarios and subsequently tasked the model with producing a comprehensive HRA analysis, which was then independently reviewed by two IDHEAS-ECA method experts. The LLM demonstrated substantial domain knowledge, generating technically coherent scenarios with appropriate procedural details and system responses, and produced a structured analysis covering cognitive functions and performance influencing factors. However, expert review identified critical methodological gaps including conflation of concepts from different HRA methods, omission of formal task analysis steps required by NUREG-2256, and inadequate human failure events identification. While current LLMs show promise as auxiliary tools for scenario generation and preliminary analysis, they require significant enhancement before supporting safety-critical HRA applications. Future work should focus on method-specific training, integration with structured knowledge representations (e.g. knowledge graphs), and development of validation protocols to ensure appropriate application boundaries."}

This paper examines the capacity of Generative Artificial Intelligence to improve customer satisfaction in the FinTech sector, concentrating on four essential value dimensions: functional, emotional, promotional, and innovative. According to the study, AI-driven solutions are critical for providing personalised products, automating services, and encouraging creativity in financial services. Data were collected via an online questionnaire, with responses from 312 users analysed using simple linear regression to test four hypotheses linking Generative AI to increased customer satisfaction. The results show that functional value, as measured by increased operational efficiency and reliability, has a significant impact on satisfaction. Emotional value emerged as a significant predictor, emphasising the importance of trust and positive affect in AI-powered financial interactions. Promotional value had a moderate but statistically significant impact, demonstrating AI\u2019s ability to personalise marketing strategies. Finally, innovative value was shown to be critical for distinguishing FinTech offerings and maintaining a competitive advantage. The findings suggest that FinTech companies that incorporate Generative AI into their service models can significantly improve user experiences, strengthen brand loyalty and improve overall customer satisfaction."}

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI."}

While this can help understand the learning material and assist with exercises, educators are voicing more and more concerns about an overreliance on generated outputs and lack of critical thinking skills. It is thus important to understand how students actually use generative AI and what impact this could have on their learning behavior. To this end, we conducted a study including an exploratory experiment with 37 programming students, giving them monitored access to ChatGPT while solving a code authoring exercise. The task was not directly solvable by ChatGPT and required code comprehension and reasoning. While only 23 of the students actually opted to use the chatbot, the majority of those eventually prompted it to simply generate a full solution. We observed two prevalent usage strategies: to seek knowledge about general concepts and to directly generate solutions. Instead of using the bot to comprehend the code and their own mistakes, students often got trapped in a vicious cycle of submitting wrong generated code and then asking the bot for a fix. Those who self-reported using generative AI regularly were more likely to prompt the bot to generate a solution. Our findings indicate that concerns about potential decrease in programmers' agency and productivity with Generative AI are justified. We discuss how researchers and educators can respond to the potential risk of students uncritically over-relying on Generative AI. We also discuss potential modifications to our study design for large-scale replications."}

Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly, paralleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups: Non-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision, domain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter utilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity verification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding a comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to general-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these categories, examining their methodological similarities and differences. Through this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key challenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research.

Instead of overt persuasion, this study applied generative AI tools to speculative imagining of future climate scenarios and their adaptation strategies, using a workshop to encourage participants to align themselves with climate action. Participants used text-to-image tools to generate visions of the future in speculative scenarios, then prompted ChatGPT for potential solutions in these scenarios. They then asked text-to-image again to visualize the ChatGPT suggestions. Participants encountered difficulties editing or removing visual elements, dealt with the lack of transparency in the generation process by specifying the physical layout as opposed to the semantics, and collaboratively developed linguistic strategies for visual depiction of novel artifacts. This work shows how generative tools can be used to prototype future scenarios and envision designs that serve social purposes."}

A functional platform typically requires a comprehensive setup of transceivers and antennas, such as WiFi devices, FMCW radars, or RFID tags, all of which come with their own limitations. RFID-based 3D HPE often suffers from tag interference and sparse readings, resulting in incomplete skeletal pose estimations, as current RFID systems capture information from only up to 12 joints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel latent diffusion transformer (LDT) framework with a cross-attention conditioning method, termed PoseCompLDT, to accurately complete 3D poses by generating the missing joints, enabling full 25-joint configurations from partial 12-joint inputs. This marks a significant advance, as it is the first approach to achieve over 20 distinct skeletal joints for wireless sensing-based continuous 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using generative AI. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PoseCompLDT in preserving motion fidelity, supported by rigorous qualitative and quantitative studies. The framework offers scalable solutions beyond RFID sensing applications, such as pedestrian tracking and health monitoring in occluded or constrained sensing environments."}

However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations."}

Very recently, some pioneering works have shown the vulnerability of the diffusion model against backdoor attacks, calling for in-depth analysis and investigation of the security challenges of this popular and fundamental AI technique. In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore the detectability of the poisoned noise input for the backdoored diffusion models, an important performance metric yet little explored in the existing works. Starting from the perspective of a defender, we first analyze the properties of the trigger pattern in the existing diffusion backdoor attacks, discovering the important role of distribution discrepancy in Trojan detection. Based on this finding, we propose a low-cost trigger detection mechanism that can effectively identify the poisoned input noise. We then take a further step to study the same problem from the attack side, proposing a backdoor attack strategy that can learn the unnoticeable trigger to evade our proposed detection scheme. Empirical evaluations across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trigger detection and detection-evading attack strategy. For trigger detection, our distribution discrepancy-based solution can achieve a 100\\% detection rate for the Trojan triggers used in the existing works. For evading trigger detection, our proposed stealthy trigger design approach performs end-to-end learning to make the distribution of poisoned noise input approach that of benign noise, enabling nearly 100\\% detection pass rate with very high attack and benign performance for the backdoored diffusion models."}

Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity."}

The paper presents a novel method for detecting emotions in customer care chat by utilizing a hybrid model that combines the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) networks. This combination of features enhanced AI capabilities. This method overcomes the limitations of current emotion recognition techniques by integrating BERTs contextual understanding with Bi-LSTMs sequential modeling power. It allows for more accurate and nuanced understanding of customer emotions. We process incoming customer messages in real time-our hybrid BERT\u2009+\u2009Bi-LSTM classifier detects emotions and a generative AI module drafts agent responses with end-to-end latency below 200 ms. Analyzing customer-agent interactions to classify emotions such as frustration, anger, sadness, and satisfaction. By incorporating Generative AI, the model not only detects emotions but also generates context-aware responses to de-escalate tense situations, providing agents with actionable insights and support. The proposed solution is validated using real-world contact center data, demonstrating superior performance in emotion recognition and aggression detection compared to existing methods. This advancement paves the way for improved customer experiences, reduced agent burnout, and enhanced operational efficiency in high-stress contact center environments. The integration of BERT-Bi-LSTM with Generative AI represents a significant step forward in creating empathetic, intelligent, and proactive customer care systems."}

While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecule design framework that finds synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemists' strategies in three steps: retrosynthesis, searching similar building blocks, and virtual synthesis. Using a search algorithm instead of a stochastic data-driven generator, SynTwins outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models at exploring synthetically accessible analogs while maintaining high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when integrated into existing molecular property-optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach produces synthetically feasible analogs with minimal loss in property scores. Our comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range of applications."}

Such synthetic content can lead to various societal challenges, including violations of privacy, defamation, and the dissemination of false information, necessitating urgent development of technical solutions for detection and prevention. This study proposes a novel detection model leveraging the shifted window mechanism and hierarchical structure of the Swin-Transformer to significantly enhance the capability to distinguish between AI-generated and real images. The proposed model was trained and validated using the RVF10k and Real and Fake Face Detection datasets to evaluate its generalization performance across diverse types of synthetic images. The model's detection capabilities were further strengthened by employing preprocessing and augmentation techniques such as Gaussian Blurring, Canny Edge Detection, Sobel Filter, and Laplacian Filter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing CNN and Transformer-based models, reliably detecting even expertly manipulated synthetic images. This study establishes a robust technical foundation to address the misuse of generative AI, aiming to further enhance the model's generalization capabilities through future expansions to various synthetic media types and the development of lightweight models capable of real-time detection. By doing so, it seeks to provide effective countermeasures against privacy breaches and the creation of inappropriate content caused by generative AI, promoting its safe utilization and contributing to the restoration of societal trust."}

In August 2025, Illinois enacted Public Act 104\u20100054, the first state statute in the United States to explicitly define and regulate the use of AI in psychotherapy services, establishing boundaries around administrative support, supplementary support, and therapeutic communication. While the Act clarifies several aspects of AI use in therapy, it also leaves important gray areas, such as whether AI-generated session summaries, psychoeducation, or risk-flagging functions should be considered therapeutic communication. Drawing on the history of empirically supported treatments in psychology, we argue that a framework of evidence, safety, fidelity, and legal compliance could help determine when AI tools should be integrated into clinical care. This approach provides a concrete pathway for balancing patient protection with responsible innovation in the rapidly evolving field of mental health AI tools."}

However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set. Such results underscore the cost-effectiveness and potential of our approach in confronting major challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and the quest for diversity in data representation."}

Furthermore, the significant energy consumption of resource-heavy AI models brings growing environmental concerns as the demand for computational resources continues to rise. This research examines the influence of computational power in AI-generated art on human aesthetic perception and emotional response. A group of 100 participants evaluated several artworks either produced by humans or created by an AI operating at three distinct levels of quality, corresponding to varying computational demands. The results showed that participants preferred AI-generated artworks created with greater computational effort, indicating higher likability and more positive emotional reactions. However, the improvements in perception and emotion were modest and exhibited diminishing returns as computational power increased.

Sentiment classification of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using categorization via machine learning and sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods is the subject of this research. A comparative study was performed between eight machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Bagging Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, and AdaBoost Classifier. Of these, SVM had the best performance with a test accuracy of 97.46%, as it can handle high-dimensional text features and can clearly define decision boundaries. Ensemble techniques such as Random Forest and Extra Trees were also quite strong but not as strong as expected, which could be due to overfitting or the poor choice of hyperparameters. For this paper, we applied a fine-tuned BERT-based Generative AI model with 98.19% accuracy for sentiment classification, greatly increasing the accuracy in classification. By means of this transformer-based framework, the model could create a more contextualized understanding of language and manage linguistic complexity, sarcasm, and ambivalence much more effectively than the conventional machine learning methods.

Finally, the implications of generative AI in software development in the future are presented, which can open a new direction in the development of software products while primarily pointing to the processes of managing the introduction of generative AI. Using the evaluation of the current possibilities and future perspectives of generative AI presented in this paper, one can conclude its impact on the future of software engineering."}

Thanks to pre-defined libraries, these frameworks not only accelerate development time but also reduce the amount of code developers need to write. However, to get the most out of the frameworks and libraries, developers need to have a deep understanding of core web programming languages. This allows them to write efficient code, troubleshoot effectively, and push the boundaries of what the frameworks can achieve. The same principle applies to Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, as they have the potential to enhance a developer's toolkit. However, they will only be useful if the developer has sound fundamental knowledge to verify the output from these tools. Educators in higher education face a similar predicament with the widespread use of Generative AI tools by learners. Many learners rely on these tools as a go-to solution without being able to verify or fully comprehend the output, leading to shallow understanding. The work in this paper outlines an approach used in a first-year web programming module within the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, where learners were encouraged to use Generative AI tools to stimulate critical thinking when conducting assessments. Specifically, GitHub CoPilot was used as a pair programmer, and ChatGPT served as a peer reviewer. In this context, the peer reviewer's role was to help the learner reflect on the tool's output. The aim of this study was to explore the design of active learning activities that incorporate Generative AI tools for web programming to foster critical thinking practices among learners. To evaluate our approach, we employed a critical thinking self-evaluation questionnaire instrument, where learners' opinions and customs were surveyed before and after both of the assignments."}

Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences. Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of 30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation strategies."}

The paper, underpinned by the theoretical lenses of Actor-Network Theory and Critical AI Studies, seeks to critically explore the network of human and non-human actors constituting the phenomenon of algorithmic creativity. The objective of this systematic review is to review and synthesise extant literature on opportunities and challenges of generative artificial intelligence in the African creative space. A comprehensive search was performed covering major academic databases (including WoS, Scopus, ProQuest, and IEEE Xplore) and grey literature from 2014 to 2025. Thematic synthesis was used in analysing the literature retrieved. The primary findings suggest a vibrant and dynamic system in which African artists are hailing AI as equal partners in creating new Afrofuturist stories, challenging cultural stereotypes, and levelling the creative playing field. Nonetheless, this adoption process is riddled with numerous risks, including algorithmic bias replication, a novel \u2018data colonialism\u2019 mode that extracts cultural value with no reciprocation, and a severe legal gap in IP protection. The review concludes that although generative AI offers novel opportunities for the expression of art, its ethical and sustainable utilisation requires a steadfast decolonial outline. A decolonial AI frame is dependent on creative sovereignty, community-centred data stewardship, and culturally responsive AI algorithmic creation to fully harness the potential of AI in African creative expression."}

Unlike traditional computational frameworks that primarily supported episodic training cycles or isolated workloads, generative AI platforms impose continuous, latency-sensitive, and governance-bound demands that strain the adequacy of legacy infrastructure models. The stakes are underscored by capital and energy trajectories: one hyperscaler has already committed $85 billion to AI capacity expansion by 2025, while the International Energy Agency projects data-center electricity consumption to nearly double, reaching ~945 TWh by 2030. These metrics illustrate both the urgency and the scale of infrastructural challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive provisioning framework built around five interdependent domains: computational resource coordination, data architecture management, network design optimization, model lifecycle orchestration, and governance system integration. Each domain embodies unique operational requirements yet interacts dynamically with the others, necessitating holistic strategies rather than piecemeal fixes. Distributed deployment architectures spanning cloud hyperscalers, regional edge facilities, and on-premises environments must simultaneously optimize for data classification, latency budgets, jurisdictional regulations, and energy efficiency. Responsible provisioning further demands the adoption of open standards, interoperable system designs, and transparent governance frameworks, all of which reduce vendor dependency while enhancing operational resilience. Ultimately, structured provisioning methodologies allow institutions not only to achieve their immediate performance and compliance objectives but also to safeguard sensitive information, maintain ecological sustainability, and ensure equitable access to generative AI capabilities."}

Things like scenario-based forecasting, sentiment analysis, and evaluating the risk of a portfolio benefit greatly from it. Financial market risk prediction is a dynamic field where using both structured and unstructured data sources is crucial. Here, to present the RAGNN framework, an innovative method that combines graph-based financial entity structural representations with semantic insights extracted from external unstructured financial documents and news in a complementary fashion. Graph Construction Layer encapsulates relational structures among financial entities; Retrieval-Augmented Embedding Layer enriches graph nodes with external contextual knowledge; Graph Neural Network with Fusion Mechanism harmonises graph and semantic embeddings; and Tribal Intelligent Evolution Optimisation (TIEO) Engine enhances model performance by optimising hyper parameters and fusion weights through evolutionary techniques.

We explore science journalists\u2019 views of AI and how they are adopting and using these new technologies. A survey methodology allowed exploration of differences between journalists in Brazil, India and the UK. The study found widespread adoption of AI tools for relatively straightforward and simple tasks (e.g. transcription, writing support). Although there is an appetite for more sophisticated use (e.g. data analysis), fears around the accuracy of AI appear to temper adoption. Significant differences were seen in the adoption of AI tools across countries, with Brazilian science journalists more widely adopting tools to support writing in a second language and journalists and India and Brazil making more widespread use of sophisticated tools than those in the UK. British journalists appeared more reticent to adopt AI tools. The study captures a transition in science journalism practices; increases in the capabilities of AI are changing working practices.

Drawing from extensive analysis of federal initiatives, including the 2025 White House Executive Order on advancing AI education, and synthesizing insights from recent scholarly and policy sources, we propose a multi-tiered approach to educational reform. This paper presents a strategic framework for transforming U.S. K-12 education through AI-integrated curriculum development and professional development programs. Our research reveals significant disparities in current implementation, with only 20-25% of educators feeling adequately prepared for AI integration despite 60-70% recognizing its importance. The framework encompasses AI literacy competencies across grade levels, differentiated professional development pathways, and a detailed technical architecture for generative AI tools in educational settings. We provide empirical evidence from international benchmarks, demonstrating that systematic approaches like Finland\u2019s \"Generation AI\" project achieve 80-90% teacher participation rates compared to 30-40% in U.S. programs. The proposed model includes phased implementation strategies, resource allocation frameworks totaling $7.2 million over three years, and comprehensive assessment mechanisms. Our findings indicate that schools implementing structured AI curricula report 25-35% higher student STEM engagement and 40-50% gains in computational thinking scores. The paper addresses critical ethical considerations, equity implications, and policy recommendations to guide sustainable AI integration while maintaining human-centered educational values.

It adopts structured interactions with the DeepSeek large language model, CL theory, and Structural Equation Modeling for analysis. Quantitative results indicate that AI-assisted paths significantly enhance design quality (72.43 vs. 65.60 in traditional paths). This improvement is attributed to a \u201cdirect effect + multiple mediators\u201d model: specifically, AI reduced the mediating role of Extraneous Cognitive Load from 0.907 to 0.017, while simultaneously enhancing its investment in Germane Cognitive Load to support deep, innovative thinking.

By all measures, the experimental system outperformed the state-of-the-art RAG system, improving the accuracy of the answers by 152% and reducing the time required to answer by 86%. This paper explores the efficiency gained when a researcher, especially one with less industry experience, has access to a capable virtual research assistant which, in turn, has access to a broad set of documents covering the domain. The paper describes the limits of a state-of-the-art RAG system, the impact of building domain awareness into a novel system and the technology areas that make a difference in that system's usefulness when presented with the volumes of material common in the industry.\n While the technology continued to be improved in general, the next round of research focused on compiling answers across a large set of documents and finding information within plots and graphs. Similar testing, this time with testers who did not have oil and gas experience, showed that subjects achieved 86% correct answers with the improved solution vs 27% with an updated baseline RAG system.\n Finally, we performed ablation testing to understand the efficacy of various search approaches in achieving these results for various types of questions."}

A structured and controlled data collection process is essential to unlock the full potential of this information. While wearable sensors for physical activity monitoring have gained significant traction in healthcare, sports science, and fitness applications, securing diverse and comprehensive datasets for research and algorithm development poses a notable challenge. In this proof-of-concept study, we underscore the significance of semantic representation in enhancing data interoperability and facilitating advanced analytics for physical activity sensor observations. Our approach focuses on enhancing the usability of physical activity datasets by employing a medical-grade (CE certified) sensor to generate synthetic datasets. Additionally, we provide insights into ethical considerations related to synthetic datasets. The study conducts a comparative analysis between real and synthetic activity datasets, assessing their effectiveness in mitigating model bias and promoting fairness in predictive analysis. We have created an ontology for semantically representing observations from physical activity sensors and conducted predictive analysis on data collected using MOX2-5 activity sensors. Until now, there has been a lack of publicly available datasets for physical activity collected with MOX2-5 activity monitoring medical grade (CE certified) device. The MOX2-5 captures and transmits high-resolution data, including activity intensity, weight-bearing, sedentary, standing, low, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, as well as steps per minute. Our dataset consists of physical activity data collected from 16 adults (Male: 12; Female: 4) over a period of 30\u201345 days (approximately 1.5 months), yielding a relatively small volume of 539 records. To address this limitation, we employ various synthetic data generation methods, such as Gaussian Capula (GC), Conditional Tabular General Adversarial Network (CTGAN), and Tabular General Adversarial Network (TABGAN), to augment the dataset with synthetic data. For both the authentic and synthetic datasets, we have developed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classification model for accurately classifying daily physical activity levels. The findings underscore the effectiveness of semantic ontology in semantic search, knowledge representation, data integration, reasoning, and capturing meaningful relationships between data. The analysis supports the hypothesis that the efficiency of predictive models improves as the volume of additional synthetic training data increases. Ontology and Generative AI hold the potential to expedite advancements in behavioral monitoring research. The data presented, encompassing both real MOX2-5 and its synthetic counterpart, serves as a valuable resource for developing robust methods in activity type classification. Furthermore, it opens avenues for exploration into research directions related to synthetic data, including model efficiency, detection of generated data, and considerations regarding data privacy."}

AI-based models have the potential to act as a convenient, customizable and easy-to-access source of information that can improve patients\u2019 self-care and health literacy and enable greater engagement with clinicians. However, serious negative outcomes could occur if these tools fail to provide reliable, relevant and understandable medical information. Herein, we review published findings on opportunities and risks associated with such use of gAI/LLMs. We reviewed 44 articles published between January 2023 and July 2024. From the included articles, we find a focus on readability and accuracy; however, only three studies involved actual patients. Responses were reported to be reasonably accurate and sufficiently readable and detailed. The most commonly reported risks were oversimplification, over-generalization, lower accuracy in response to complex questions, and lack of transparency regarding information sources. There are ethical concerns that overreliance/unsupervised reliance on gAI/LLMs could lead to the \u201chumanizing\u201d of these models and pose a risk to patient health equity, inclusiveness and data privacy. For these technologies to be truly transformative, they must become more transparent, have appropriate governance and monitoring, and incorporate feedback from healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients, and other experts. Uptake of these technologies will also need education and awareness among non-specialist audiences around their optimal use as sources of plain language medical information."}

In education, AI has generated significant excitement among students for its potential to enhance learning experiences. However, concerns about overreliance on AI temper this enthusiasm, as it may undermine the development of critical thinking skills. Numerous studies have highlighted the risks associated with students\u2019 excessive use of generative AI (GAI) in academic tasks, noting its potential to diminish cognitive abilities. However, the optimal use of AI to enhance students\u2019 critical thinking skills remains under-researched. Therefore, this study seeks to answer the question: How does generative AI influence students\u2019 critical thinking, self-efficacy, and decision-making? This study aims to explore the synergic relationship between human intelligence and artificial intelligence in augmenting essential thinking skills among students and building upon their existing cognitive resources through self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. Specifically, it explores the cause-and-effect connections among GAI, self-efficacy, decision-making, learning motivation, and critical thinking skills. A quantitative methodology used an online questionnaire to collect responses from 165 undergraduate, master\u2019s, and doctoral students. Statistical analyses, including bootstrapping techniques, were conducted to examine direct and indirect effects. The results revealed that GAI has a significant positive influence on self-efficacy, learning motivation, decision-making, and critical thinking skills. In turn, self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making significantly impact critical thinking skills. The mediating results indicated that GAI can indirectly boost students\u2019 critical thinking by enhancing self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. This suggests that AI capabilities can transform the cognitive learning process."}

In this paper, we present the Anticipate, Simulate, Reason (ASR) framework, a generative AI method that enables users to proactively identify and comprehend scams within instant messaging platforms. Using large language models, ASR predicts scammer responses, creates realistic scam conversations, and delivers real-time, interpretable support to end-users. We develop ScamGPT-J, a domain-specific language model fine-tuned on a new, high-quality dataset of scam conversations covering multiple scam types. Thorough experimental evaluation shows that the ASR framework substantially enhances scam detection, particularly in challenging contexts such as job scams, and uncovers important demographic patterns in user vulnerability and perceptions of AI-generated assistance. Our findings reveal a contradiction where those most at risk are often least receptive to AI support, emphasizing the importance of user-centered design in AI-driven fraud prevention.

While it can support more efficient learning, improper use may lead to legal issues or hinder self-directed learning. Medical education is no exception, as generative AI has the potential to become a powerful tool. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated how generative AI is perceived among medical students and utilized within the realm of medical education. Methods: In January 2024, we conducted a study with 123 second-year medical students who had completed a physiology course and laboratory training at Gunma University, Japan. Students used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) 3.5 (OpenAI) for four tasks and evaluated its responses. A survey on the use of generative AI was also conducted. Responses from 117 participants were analyzed, excluding six non-participants. Results: Among the students, 41.9% had used ChatGPT. The average scores for tasks 1-4 were 6.5, 4.6, 7.4, and 6.2 out of 10, respectively. Although 13% had a negative impression, 54 students found it challenging to apply for medical purposes. However, 64.1% expressed a willingness to continue using generative AI, provided its use extended beyond medical contexts. Conclusions: Nearly 60% of students had never used generative AI before, which is consistent with general usage trends. Although they were impressed by the speed of generative AI responses, many students found that it lacked precision for medical studies and required additional verification. Limitations of generative AI, such as \u201challucinations,\u201d were evident in medical education. It remains important to educate students on AI literacy and their understanding of the potential issues that generative AI could bring about."}

Bayesian methods enable the integration of domain expertise through prior elicitation, allow for continuous learning from new data, and provide robust uncertainty quantification via posterior inference. We demonstrate how Bayesian inference can be applied to GenAI evaluation, particularly in incorporating stakeholder perspectives to enhance fairness, transparency, and reliability. Furthermore, we discuss Bayesian workflows as an iterative process for model validation and refinement, ensuring robust assessments of GenAI systems in dynamic, real-world contexts."}

This study presents an empirical study on incorporating MATH41 into a 15-week pre-service teacher preparation course for mathematics majors. Twenty-four participants learned to create parameterized math problems, generate vector graphics. Following guided training, each participant designed and micro-taught a 20-minute lesson incorporating MATH41-generated resources. Reflection journals and final lesson plans were analyzed thematically, while 20 participants completed a self-assessment survey on lesson design competency. Results reveal that the automated problem generation capabilities motivated pre-service teachers to explore a broader range of instructional strategies, including personalized tasks and diverse problem variants. Reflection data indicate that while integrating AI tools can significantly boost confidence and creativity in lesson planning, careful pedagogical alignment remains essential to avoid superficial learning. Participants underscored the importance of maintaining teacher oversight\u2014especially when adapting AI-generated problems for particular learner needs. Additionally, their post-course self-assessments showed high confidence in digital tool integration, yet they acknowledged that anticipating student misconceptions requires further field experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding how teacher education programs can enhance lesson design competencies via structured AI tool integration. It also highlights the critical role of reflective practice in ensuring that automated content creation fosters deeper instructional effectiveness rather than uncritical AI dependency."}

Although significant process has been made in semantic communications, a fundamental design problem is that the semantic information is extracted based on certain criteria at the transmitter alone, without considering the receiver\u2019s specific information needs. As a result, critical information of primary concern to the receiver may be lost. In such cases, the semantic transmission becomes meaningless to the receiver, as all received information is irrelevant to its interests. To solve this problem, this paper presents a receiver-centric generative semantic communication system, where each transmission is initialized by the receiver. Specifically, the receiver first sends its request for the desired semantic information to the transmitter at the start of each transmission. Then, the transmitter extracts the required semantic information accordingly. A key challenge is how the transmitter understands the receiver\u2019s requests for semantic information and extracts the required semantic information in a reasonable and robust manner. We address this challenge by designing a well-structured framework and leveraging off-the-shelf generative AI products, such as GPT-4, along with several specialized tools for detection and estimation. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed new semantic communication system."}

This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to address this gap by examining the extent and nature of GenAI integration in future science teachers' preparation programs. Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology, 21 peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2022 and 2025 were identified and analyzed through qualitative thematic synthesis. The analysis addresses three research questions: 1) the extent to which GenAI is used in the curriculum of PSTs in science education; 2) how PSTs use GenAI tools to develop a deeper understanding of science and develop scientific reasoning; and 3) how PSTs in science education are using GenAI tools to plan and carry out teaching activities. Findings reveal that the integration of GenAI into curricula remains fragmented and often experimental, typically confined to technology-related courses or pilot projects. PSTs primarily utilize GenAI tools for conceptual clarification, hypothesis generation, and self-regulated learning. Furthermore, these tools serve as cognitive partners in designing lesson plans, differentiating instruction, and simulating classroom scenarios. However, the absence of structured pedagogical guidance often leads to superficial use and limited critical evaluation of AI-generated content. This review highlights the transformative potential of GenAI in science education while underscoring the need for institutional frameworks, faculty training, and the development of AI literacy. Future research should focus on how to sustainably integrate GenAI into teacher education to foster scientific reasoning, pedagogical adaptability, and responsible use of technology."}

Although the concept of artificial intelligence has been known for a long time, the concept of artificial knowledge is quite new and emerged with the explosion of Generative AI (GenAI) applications, especially with ChatGPT. This is a conceptual paper based on a semantic literature review and the theory of knowledge fields and knowledge dynamics. Artificial knowledge became a reality, and its analysis is performed within the framework of knowledge management systems. However, any search on Google or Google Scholar will show entries on artificial intelligence and not on artificial knowledge. That is a demonstration of the need to address research on artificial knowledge and to reflect on the mode of integrating artificial knowledge within the knowledge management systems. Artificial knowledge is the product of machine learning and deep learning processes and of the processing power of artificial intelligence. Unlike human knowledge that manifests in different forms, artificial knowledge manifests only as a rational form. Therefore, its integration within the knowledge management systems should be done only in those processes which are based on human rational knowledge. The present analysis helps managers in understanding how to combine human and artificial knowledge in the new hybrid knowledge management systems."}

Assisted by digital twin (DT) technologies, connected autonomous vehicles (AVs), roadside units (RSUs), and virtual simulators can maintain the vehicular MR Metaverse via simulations for sharing data and making driving decisions collaboratively. However, it is challenging and costly to enable large-scale traffic and driving simulation via realistic data collection and fusion from the physical world for online prediction and offline training in autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose an autonomous driving architecture, where generative AI is leveraged to synthesize unlimited conditioned traffic and driving data via simulations for improving driving safety and traffic control efficiency. First, we propose a multi-task DT offloading model for the reliable execution of heterogeneous DT tasks with different requirements at RSUs. Then, based on the preferences of AV's DTs and real-world data, virtual simulators can synthesize unlimited conditioned driving and traffic datasets for improved robustness. Finally, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to provide fine-grained incentives for RSUs on providing resources for autonomous driving. The property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism and architecture are strategy-proof and effective."}

The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new considerations about how these tools can help or hinder students' development of STEM problem-solving competency. Our research examines these considerations by studying how and why college students use genAI tools in their STEM coursework, focusing on their problem-solving support. We surveyed 40 STEM college students from diverse U.S. institutions and 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor perspectives on effective genAI tool use and guidance in STEM courses. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications of genAI tools among STEM students. The most common use cases include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools was to save time. Moreover, over half of student participants reported simply inputting problems for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoption rates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short in enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies. The study also explored students' and STEM instructors' perceptions of the benefits and risks associated with using genAI tools in STEM education. Our findings provide insights into how to guide students on appropriate genAI use in STEM courses and how to design genAI-based tools to foster students' problem-solving competency."}

Unlike traditional generative AI, which is reactive to user prompts, agentic AI proactively orchestrates complex workflows. It exhibits stochastic, dynamic, and fluid autonomy: its steps and outputs vary probabilistically (stochastic), it evolves based on prior interactions (dynamic), and it operates with significant independence within human-defined parameters, adapting to context (fluid). While this fosters complex, co-evolutionary human-machine interactions capable of generating uniquely synthesized creative outputs, it also irrevocably blurs boundaries--human and machine contributions become irreducibly entangled in intertwined creative processes. Consequently, agentic AI poses significant challenges to legal frameworks reliant on clear attribution: authorship doctrines struggle to disentangle ownership, intellectual property regimes strain to accommodate recursively blended novelty, and liability models falter as accountability diffuses across shifting loci of control. The central issue is not the legal treatment of human versus machine contributions, but the fundamental unmappability--the practical impossibility in many cases--of accurately attributing specific creative elements to either source. When retroactively parsing contributions becomes infeasible, applying distinct standards based on origin becomes impracticable. Therefore, we argue, legal and policy frameworks may need to treat human and machine contributions as functionally equivalent--not for moral or economic reasons, but as a pragmatic necessity."}

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (CS2) course covers extremely important knowledge and skills of becoming a computer scientist. However, students might fail to meet the learning outcomes of CS2 course, somewhat due to the abstract nature of concepts but also because of a misunderstanding of concepts, the selection of inappropriate data structure and algorithm, a lack of effective debugging skills, and writing inefficient code. Currently we are in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, and generative AI (also widely known as AI chatbots) are already popular across college and university campuses. Generative AI that are designed to learn and mimic human conversation is capable of generating, translating, or paraphrasing text and answering questions in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated content. We investigate the above-mentioned potential challenges faced by students while learning CS2 course at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and redesign the course homework in Fall 2023 semester. The objectives of the redesigned course homework are to provide students with opportunities to use generative AI to support their learning in the CS2 course as well as measure the effectiveness of utilizing generative AI to improve student learning outcomes in the CS2 course. At the end of Fall 2023 semester, we conducted a student perception survey in the CS2 course and collected valuable feedback from 47 out of 61 students (77% response rate). In summary, 85.1%, 76.6%, 74.5%, 63.8%, and 70.2% respondents indicated that generative AI help to understand testing and debugging better, improve coding skills and code quality, design and implement efficient data structures and algorithms, select appropriate algorithms and data structures with the assistance of generative AI, and under-stand the importance of designing and implementing efficient data structures and algorithms, respectively. In this paper, we summarize the experience of redesigning CS2 course homework at OSU, share lessons learned, and provide candid suggestions for utilizing course homework in CS2 courses at other institutions."}

A total of 120 compositions were analyzed\u201460 produced by ChatGPT-4 and 60 authored by Chinese L2 English learners from the Ten-thousand English Compositions of Chinese Learners corpus\u2014equally distributed across three educational proficiency levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Quantitative analyses indicate that human-authored compositions exhibit a progressive increase in lexical complexity aligned with educational advancement, while ChatGPT-generated texts demonstrate limited differentiation between primary and secondary levels, followed by a sharp lexical elevation at the tertiary level. This pattern suggests an algorithmic reliance on generalized\u00a0 discourse rather than sensitivity to developmental variation. In terms of syntactic complexity, ChatGPT consistently produces structurally uniform texts with high usage of subordinate clauses and logical subordination, whereas human writing displays greater contextual flexibility, albeit with occasional simplification. Regarding textual cohesion, ChatGPT-generated compositions\u2014particularly at the tertiary level\u2014rely heavily on overt logical connectors and referential markers, resulting in structurally coherent but stylistically formulaic discourse. In contrast, human-authored texts, while sometimes lacking explicit cohesion markers, employ more nuanced devices such as collocations and implicit semantic links. Error analysis reveals a near absence of grammatical, lexical, and orthographic errors in ChatGPT outputs, contrasting with the relatively high error frequency in human compositions, especially at lower proficiency levels. These findings highlight ChatGPT\u2019s strengths in producing grammatically accurate and syntactically complex texts, yet also underscore its limitations in mimicking authentic learner development and stylistic variability. The study concludes that while generative AI can serve as an effective auxiliary tool in L2 writing instruction, its pedagogical integration should be carefully calibrated to avoid undermining learners\u2019 development of rhetorical sensitivity, authorial voice, and context-appropriate expression."}

However, a fundamental challenge remains as users struggle to anticipate what AI will generate. As a result, they must engage in excessive turn-taking with the AI's feedback to clarify their intent, leading to significant cognitive load and time investment. Our goal is to advance the perspective that in order for users to seamlessly leverage the full potential of GenAI systems across various contexts, we must design GenAI systems that not only provide informative feedback but also informative feedforward -- designs that tell users what AI will generate before the user submits their prompt. To spark discussion on feedforward in GenAI, we designed diverse instantiations of feedforward across four GenAI applications: conversational UIs, document editors, malleable interfaces, and automation agents, and discussed how these designs can contribute to a more rigorous investigation of a design space and a set of guidelines for feedforward in all GenAI systems."}

Recently emerging large-scale generative AI has expanded from large language models (LLMs) to multi-modal models, showing potential to revolutionize the entire process of medical imaging. However, comprehensive reviews on their development status and future challenges are currently lacking. This scoping review systematically organizes existing literature on the clinical value of large-scale generative AI applications by following PCC guidelines. A systematic search was conducted across four databases: PubMed, EMbase, IEEE-Xplore, and Google Scholar, and 15 studies meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria set by the researchers were reviewed. Most of these studies focused on improving the efficiency of report generation in specific parts of the interpretation process or on translating reports to aid patient understanding, with the latest studies extending to AI applications performing direct interpretations. All studies were quantitatively evaluated by clinicians, with most utilizing LLMs and only three employing multi-modal models. Both LLMs and multi-modal models showed excellent results in specific areas, but none yet outperformed radiologists in diagnostic performance. Most studies utilized GPT, with few using models specialized for the medical imaging domain. This study provides insights into the current state and limitations of large-scale generative AI-based applications in the medical imaging field, offering foundational data and suggesting that the era of medical imaging foundation models is on the horizon, which may fundamentally transform clinical practice in the near future."}

We tasked ChatGPT with providing responses to 13 psychology research methods scenarios as well as to rate each of the five response options that were already developed for each scenario by the research team. ChatGPT responded in ways that would typically be regarded as displaying a high level of psychological literacy. The response options which were previously rated by two groups of SMEs were then compared with ratings provided by ChatGPT. The Pearson's correlations were very high (r's\u2009=\u2009.73 and .80, respectively), as were the Spearman's rhos (rho's\u2009=\u2009.81 and .82, respectively).

A recent advancement in text-to-image generative AI is GLIDE (Guided Language to Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing). There are a number of representations available in the GLIDE model, but it has not been refined for medical applications. Methods For text-conditional image synthesis with classifier-free guidance, we have fine-tuned GLIDE using 10,015 dermoscopic images of seven diagnostic entities, including melanoma and melanocytic nevi. Photorealistic synthetic samples of each diagnostic entity were created by the algorithm. Following this, an experienced dermatologist reviewed 140 images (20 of each entity), with 10 samples originating from artificial intelligence and 10 from original images from the dataset. The dermatologist classified the provided images according to the seven diagnostic entities. Additionally, the dermatologist was asked to indicate whether or not a particular image was created by AI. Further, we trained a deep learning model to compare the diagnostic results of dermatologist versus machine for entity classification. Results The results indicate that the generated images possess varying degrees of quality and realism, with melanocytic nevi and melanoma having higher similarity to real images than other classes. The integration of synthetic images improved the classification performance of the model, resulting in higher accuracy and precision. The AI assessment showed superior classification performance compared to dermatologist. Conclusion Overall, the results highlight the potential of synthetic images for training and improving AI models in dermatology to overcome data scarcity."}

However, collecting real-world network data at scale often faces significant challenges, including privacy concerns, operational constraints, and the rarity of certain events or conditions. Generative AI offers a promising solution by synthesizing realistic data that mirrors complex network dynamics and user behavior.In many application domains-such as mobile connectivity, cybersecurity, and disaster recovery-realism is not only defined by accurate replication of structural features (e.g., connectivity graphs), but also by the ability to model how these features evolve over time. Capturing these temporal dynamics is critical to ensure that AI models trained on synthetic data can generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. One effective approach to this challenge is to transform raw graph data into a compact latent representation, which can then be processed by a temporal generative model. This two-stage framework enables the learning of both structural and temporal characteristics of the underlying system, offering a more comprehensive generative pipeline.Building on previous work that employed Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) for this purpose, this paper explores an alternative temporal generative model: DoppelGANger. By integrating DoppelGANger into the graph generation pipeline, we aim to assess whether it can more accurately capture the dynamics of evolving graph structures. Furthermore, we introduce a more rigorous and detailed evaluation of the generated data by comparing decoded synthetic graph sequences against their real-world counterparts using distribution-aware and graph-structural metrics. These metrics provide a clearer picture of the quality and fidelity of the generated data, highlighting key differences between the TimeGAN and DoppelGANger approaches."}

Yet, technical details of GenAI are largely inapproachable to most students. This article develops a learning module for GenAI and seeks to examine whether this module can potentially affect students\u2019 perceptions toward GenAI.We implemented a one-lecture (60-min) module on GenAI models, with primary focus on structures of LLM-based chatbots, during the last week of a Biomedical Engineering (BME) Machine Learning course. A mixed-methods survey on perceptions of GenAI was distributed to the students before and after the module. Paired t-tests and regression analyses were used to analyze the Likert-scale quantitative questions and thematic coding was performed for the free-response questions.Students (N\u202f=\u202f13) reported significantly stronger approval on favorability to use GenAI in medicine (p\u202f=\u202f0.015), understanding of LLM-based chatbots (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), confidence on using LLM-based chatbots (p\u202f=\u202f0.027), optimism on future development of LLMs (p\u202f=\u202f0.020), and perception of instructor\u2019s attitude toward GenAI (p\u202f=\u202f0.033). Students maintained a neutral view on accuracy of LLM-generated answers and a negative view on the ability of generating bias-free answers in LLMs. The primary contributors identified in students\u2019 intentions to use LLMs are self-efficacy in using the LLM outputs and lower precepted bias of LLMs. The impression of GenAI for students shifted from primarily LLM-based chatbots and generative work to components and training process of GenAI. After the module, students reported a clear understanding of tokenizers and word embeddings while expressing confusion on transformers.A module on the details of GenAI models shifted the students\u2019 attitudes to GenAI models positively while still being acutely aware of its limitations. We believe that inclusion of such modules in a modern engineering curriculum will help students achieve AI literacy."}

While traditional, human-led SLRs are labor-intensive, AI-driven approaches promise efficiency and scalability. However, the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated literature reviews remain uncertain. This study investigates the performance of GPT-4-powered Consensus in conducting an SLR on Big Data research, comparing its results with a manually conducted SLR. To evaluate Consensus, we analyzed its ability to detect relevant studies, extract key insights, and synthesize findings. Our human-led SLR identified 32 primary studies (PSs) and 207 related works, whereas Consensus detected 22 PSs, with 16 overlapping with the manual selection and 5 false positives. The AI-selected studies had an average citation count of 202 per study, significantly higher than the 64.4 citations per study in the manual SLR, indicating a possible bias toward highly cited papers. However, none of the 32 PSs selected manually were included in the AI-generated results, highlighting recall and selection accuracy limitations. Key findings reveal that Consensus accelerates literature retrieval but suffers from hallucinations, reference inaccuracies, and limited critical analysis. Specifically, it failed to capture nuanced research challenges and missed important application domains. Precision, recall, and F1 scores of the AI-selected studies were 76.2%, 38.1%, and 50.6%, respectively, demonstrating that while AI retrieves relevant papers with high precision, it lacks comprehensiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a hybrid AI-human SLR framework, where AI enhances search efficiency while human reviewers ensure rigor and validity. While AI can support literature reviews, human oversight remains essential for ensuring accuracy and depth. Future research should assess AI-assisted SLRs across multiple disciplines to validate generalizability and explore domain-specific LLMs for improved performance."}

The ability of these systems to simulate human capabilities such as text writing and image creation is radically redefining a wide range of practices, from artistic production to education. While there is no doubt that these innovations are beneficial to our lives, the pervasiveness of these technologies should not be underestimated, and raising increasingly pressing ethical questions that require a radical resemantization of certain notions traditionally ascribed to humans alone. Among these notions, that of technological intentionality plays a central role. With regard to this notion, this paper first aims to highlight what we propose to define in terms of the intentionality gap, whereby, insofar as, currently, (1) it is increasingly difficult to assign responsibility for the actions performed by AI systems to humans, as these systems are increasingly autonomous, and (2) it is increasingly complex to reconstruct the reasoning behind the results they produce as we move away from good old fashioned AI; it is now even more difficult to trace the intentionality of AI systems back to the intentions of the developers and end users. This gap between human and technological intentionality requires a revision of the concept of intentionality; to this end, we propose here to assign preter-intentional behavior to generative AI. We use this term to highlight how AI intentionality both incorporates and transcends human intentionality; i.e., it goes beyond (preter) human intentionality while being linked to it. To show the merits of this notion, we first rule out the possibility that such preter-intentionality is merely an unintended consequence and then explore its nature by comparing it with some paradigmatic notions of technological intentionality present in the wider debate on the moral (and technological) status of AI."}

However, when users utilize GAI models provided by the service provider, they cannot be certain that the model\u2019s quality matches the provider\u2019s claims. Considering the need to protect intellectual property, the service provider will not disclose model details for user verification. To this end, we take the Internet of Vehicles as research background, proposing a zero knowledge model proof architecture based on UAVs. We also introduce a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the verification process. In specific, we first propose a verification scheme for the key operations of generative adversarial networks based on noninteractive zero knowledge proof. The zero knowledge proof architecture ensures that model parameters cannot be stolen during the verification process. After that, we propose an Age of Verification (AoV) metric to ensure the timeliness and freshness of zero knowledge proof. We also construct a tradeoff optimization problem between the energy consumption of UAV as a verifier and the AoV of edge servers as service providers, and transform the problem based on Lyapunov optimization theory. Following that, we propose an enhanced multiagent proximal policy optimization algorithm to enable the collaborative verification of edge servers by multiple UAVs. The algorithm simulation results demonstrate that the reward value of our proposed algorithm is over 10% higher than that of the standard algorithm, with a faster and more stable overall convergence speed. Additionally, the zero knowledge proof performance test results indicate that the verification delay in our proposed architecture is less than 500 ms during the verification phase, meeting practical requirements."}

At the time it was explicit that the fragmentation of genetic datasets was a major obstacle to understand the processes driving cancer. A team of expert curators and bioinformaticians was tasked with identifying and cataloguing data related to somatic variants, as well as relevant demographic, clinical, and patient information from published studies and making these data easily accessible to the research community. Over the last two decades we have witnessed the incredible progress in cancer genomics enabling whole genome studies, resulting in the exponential growth of data generated by cancer research. During its first year, COSMIC integrated data from 1672 scientific papers, cataloguing 1755 unique mutations across 21 genes. At present, twenty years later it is common for a single publication to describe tens of thousands of genome-wide mutations and now COSMIC includes 24 million genomic variants collected from more than 1.5 million patient samples acquired from over 29,000 scientific publications. Today, an important part of COSMIC's mission is to help translate this information for improving cancer treatment and patient care. To achieve this, the main catalogue of somatic mutations is supported by 6 accompanying resources that focus on different aspects of molecular oncology. The Cancer Gene Census and Cancer Mutation Census describe the roles of genes and mutations in oncogenesis, based on literature curation and analysis of the core mutation catalogue. COSMIC 3-D visualises mutation frequency in the context of the protein structure, and Mutational Signatures catalogues the mutagenic processes behind the nature of mutations at the genome level. To help target molecular alterations in clinical practice, Actionability and the catalogue of mutations causing drug resistance inform the availability of therapeutic options for cancer and how their efficacy is influenced by the genetic profile of the cancer. The ongoing development of sequencing techniques and new diagnostic methods as well as computational approaches, including deep learning and use of generative AI, give us hope that the next 20 years will be equally revolutionary for data-driven oncology. However, the abundance of new sources of diverse datasets makes data fragmentation an evolving challenge for the whole research community. Developing and adopting common standards for data formats, management and usage will be critical to assure inclusive, efficient, and effective translation of genomic research into a clinical practice.\n Citation Format: Zbyslaw Sondka, Madiha Ahmed, Joanna Argasinska, David Beare, Nidhi Bindal Dhir, Denise Carvalho-Silva, Manpreet Singh Chawla, Stephen Duke, Ilaria Fasanella, Muhammed Fouzan, Avirup Guha Neogi, Susan Haller, Bhavana Harsha, Balazs Hetenyi, Leonie Hodges, Alex Holmes, Steven Jupe, Rachel Lyne, Madhumita Madhumita, Thomas Maurel, Karen McLaren, Sumodh Nair, Helder Pedro, Amaia Sangrador-Vegas, Helen Schuilenburg, Zoe Sheard, Michael Starkey, Rebecca Steele, Sari Ward, Jennifer Wilding, Siew Yit Yong, Jon Teague.

A deep case-study was performed to explore interactions with AI-generated dance sequences as an inspiration source in dance composition and improvization. We present a simple interface created in collaboration with an experienced dancer for browsing AI-generated dance. By including glitches, the physics-breaking mistakes often encountered in AI-generated artefacts, we examine their affordances and possible use cases through sessions with the dancer. Through a process of reflexive thematic analysis, we identified that generative AI can engage a dancer through surprise, inspiring a transformation from abstract to physical movements. Our work challenges existing notions of the importance of realism in dance generation models, exemplifies the importance of close collaboration with practitioners in evaluating AI-generated artefacts and proposes glitch as a potential use case for dance ideation as it encourages dancers to embody unfamiliar movement qualities and break from ingrained patterns."}

This survey study explores how Gen-AI can revolutionize TSMO through enhanced data integration, automated knowledge extraction, and predictive modeling. By synthesizing diverse datasets, Gen-AI facilitates the creation of unified knowledge repositories, improves real-time decision-making, and supports proactive scenario planning. The study introduces a comprehensive framework for embedding Gen-AI into TSMO workflows, enabling streamlined operational efficiency, cross-agency collaboration, and scalable data-driven strategies. Key applications of Gen-AI in TSMO include adaptive traffic control, crash response planning, and predictive modeling for future traffic scenarios. The study highlights innovative Gen-AI models and techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid augmented intelligence frameworks, which collectively enhance TSMO's capacity for resilience and responsiveness. Despite its transformative potential, Gen-AI adoption faces critical challenges, including ethical considerations, computational constraints, and the need for stakeholder trust. The paper emphasizes the importance of responsible AI development, fairness, and explainability to ensure sustainable adoption.

The businesses place great importance on achieving precise outcomes and demand accuracy in generated results, thus the establishment of benchmark metrics is necessary, and the metrics should convey confidence in the prediction. However, a significant obstacle is validating the effectiveness of the results because of the absence of the definitive ground truth labels for validation purposes. To overcome the obstacle of absence of true labels in text completion models, this research presents a unique approach for quantitative prediction analysis. Our method leverages the log probabilities associated with each token of the generated text and considers both variation in token probabilities and deviation from the most probable token. By focusing on the top five most probable tokens, our metric effectively calculates a pseudo-confidence score, providing industries with a reliable measure of confidence in generative AI models. This novel metric contributes to the advancement of generative AI validation methods, enabling businesses to have greater confidence in the application of generative models for various challenges."}

A key phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization - where a strong model trained on a weak model's outputs surpasses the weak model in task performance - has gained significant attention. Yet, whether critical trustworthiness properties such as robustness, fairness, and privacy can generalize similarly remains an open question. In this work, we study this question by examining if a stronger model can inherit trustworthiness properties when fine-tuned on a weaker model's outputs, a process we term weak-to-strong trustworthiness generalization. To address this, we introduce two foundational training strategies: 1) Weak Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak TFT), which leverages trustworthiness regularization during the fine-tuning of the weak model, and 2) Weak and Weak-to-Strong Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak+WTS TFT), which extends regularization to both weak and strong models. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets reveals that while some trustworthiness properties, such as fairness, adversarial, and OOD robustness, show significant improvement in transfer when both models were regularized, others like privacy do not exhibit signs of weak-to-strong trustworthiness. As the first study to explore trustworthiness generalization via weak-to-strong generalization, our work provides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of weak-to-strong generalization."}

In response, this paper explored the future of college education and artificial intelligence (AI). First, a proper understanding of how large language models (LLMs) \u201ctrain\u201d and \u201clearn,\u201d along with their abilities and limitations, was established. Simply put, while LLMs produce plausible linguistic output, they are \u201cstochastic parrots\u201d that have no actual understanding of language. \nNext, we examined the dangers of generative AI and discovered that they might help in the creation and dissemination of misinformation. Even if these AI are not used with malicious intent, the fact that their training data sets are drawn from the internet\u2014which reflects majority thinking\u2014means that they can perpetuate and amplify social inequality and hegemonic stereotypes and biases. On the other hand, if we consider what is missing from the training data, it is only natural that marginalized voices should be even more marginalized. In addition, leaving the issue of the socially vulnerable aside, LLMs can only be trained on digital data, meaning analog data is ignored. This is in line with the idea of \u201cthe destruction of history\u201d put forth by Joseph Weizenbaum, an early critic who warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence. \nWe then discussed the relationship between humans and machines and considered which relationships were problematic and which were desirable. Researchers in the aviation industry recognized the problem of automation bias from an early date, but this phenomenon can be seen in other areas of society as well. Put simply, if a human places too much trust in a machine, they abdicate their decision-making responsibility to that machine and thus fail to respond quickly to solve any problems that may arise should that machine malfunction. LLMs do not endanger lives in the same way that airplanes do, but a similar bias can be seen with them as well. A more important issue, though, is the fact that people are no longer seen as whole human beings but as computers. This tendency was evident long before the advent of computers, for example in the attempts to quantify human intelligence through IQ tests, but it is a problem we must be particularly wary of in the age of AI. \nLastly, we considered means for college education to find its way in the present situation. Educators in the US in particular, while dealing with ChatGPT, have pinpointed not the LLMs themselves but the \u201ctransactional nature\u201d of education as the problem. That is, they argue that education has long since become less a process of learning and more a transaction in which students receive grades and degrees. Given this transactional environment, it is no wonder that student would rely too much on ChatGPT. This over-reliance, however, comes with side effects: not learning how to think properly, a lack of sufficient academic information, and learning an AI-based writing style. In response, US educators have proposed both \u201cstick\u201d (strategies that make it difficult for students to use LLMs) and \u201ccarrot\u201d (strategies that encourage students to learn like human beings, not algorithms) solutions, but the heart of the matter seems to be a sense of responsibility. Creating an educational environment in which students can develop a sense of responsibility for themselves is the path forward for education in the age of AI. If we do this, LLMs can become a useful tool rather than an enemy to fear."}

For e-learning, particularly in the context of language learning, no AIGI dataset is currently available. To fill this gap, we first proposed an AIGI quality dataset for language learning. Both subjective and objective assessments have been conducted on the proposed dataset. The findings from subjective assessment show that higher perceptual quality also corresponds to a more substantial alignment. It also shows that the average MOS scores of images generated from Stability AI models are similar and lower than images generated by the Dall.E3 model. The results of the objective assessment indicate that the performance of off-the-shelf quality models is generally low. In addition, results from finetuning learning-based quality models show that significant gains and improvements can be achieved using the dataset. The results of the alignment evaluation show that the HPS model is the best, and realistic images in the dataset produced the best alignment correlation compared to the other styles in the dataset. The findings also show that multimodal large language models, such as vision-enabled GPT-4 (GPT-4V), still struggle to produce alignment scores that correlate with humans."}

Nonetheless, the variety in approaches to chatbot development, ranging from rule-based systems to generative AI, creates difficulties in harmonizing design decisions with user requirements and technical limitations. This research seeks to examine and contrast the primary approaches employed in chatbot creation: rule-based, retrieval-based, and generative-based systems. Employing a descriptive-qualitative methodology, the study is carried out in the first quarter of 2025 and utilizes scholarly literature, technical documents, and case studies of Mitsuku, Google Assistant, and ChatGPT, concentrating on applications in Indonesia and Malaysia. A comparative analysis assesses every method based on development complexity, accuracy, flexibility, user experience, interpretability, cost, and ethical risks. The results indicate that rule-based systems provide low expenses and significant transparency, but they fall short in scalability and flexibility. Retrieval-based systems excel in accuracy for domain-specific queries but struggle with new interactions. Chatbots based on generative models provide the most natural and contextually aware interactions, but they require significant resources and present issues related to interpretability and ethics. The research suggests that hybrid models integrating control and adaptability could be the most efficient approach. Further studies are required to improve transparency in generative systems, reduce bias, and create adaptive hybrid architectures appropriate for Southeast Asian use."}

In this paper, we present various scenarios of malicious prompt engineering to encourage the chatbot for spam email generation and rewriting the existing email. Also, we present the adversarial prompt engineering examples intended to evade the detection by spam filters by means of rewriting the given email while circumventing common spam characteristics. We experimentally evaluate the practical feasibility of prompt engineering on ChatGPT by assessing the performance of six common ML-based spam filters with emails modified by ChatG PT. From the experimental results, we show that adversarial prompt engineering decreases the performance of common ML-based spam filters, while NLP-based filter is robust to such modification. We also demonstrate that including ChatG PT rewritten emails in the training set leads to more robust ML-based spam filters, while the use of available AI-text detectors does not guarantee high detection rates of emails modified by the chatbot."}

They use Langevin dynamics, represented as stochastic differential equations, to describe a process that transforms data into noise, the forward process, and a process that transforms noise into generated data, the reverse process. Many of these methods utilize auxiliary variables that formulate the data as a ``position\"variable, and the auxiliary variables are referred to as ``velocity\", ``acceleration\", etc. In this sense, it is possible to ``critically damp\"the dynamics. Critical damping has been successfully introduced in Critically-Damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD) and Critically-Damped Third-Order Langevin Dynamics (TOLD++), but has not yet been applied to dynamics of arbitrary order. The proposed methodology generalizes Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics (HOLD), a recent state-of-the-art diffusion method, by introducing the concept of critical damping from systems analysis. Similarly to TOLD++, this work proposes an optimal set of hyperparameters in the $n$-dimensional case, where HOLD leaves these to be user defined. Additionally, this work provides closed-form solutions for the mean and covariance of the forward process that greatly simplify its implementation.

This study examined whether using generative AI for information search enhances choice satisfaction and reduces choice difficulty among older adults. A total of 130 participants (younger, n = 56; older, n = 74) completed a music-selection task under AI-use and AI-nonuse conditions across two contexts: previously experienced (road trip) and not previously experienced (space travel). In the AI-nonuse condition, participants generated candidate options from memory; in the AI-use condition, GPT-4o presented options tailored to individual preferences. Cognitive functions, including working memory, processing speed, verbal comprehension, and perceptual reasoning, were assessed. Results showed that AI use significantly reduced perceived choice difficulty across age groups, with larger benefits in unfamiliar contexts. Regarding cognitive function, among older adults, lower cognitive function was associated with fewer recalled options, higher choice difficulty, and lower satisfaction in the AI-nonuse condition; these associations were substantially attenuated when AI was used. These results demonstrate that generative AI can mitigate age-related cognitive constraints by reducing the cognitive load associated with information search during decision making. While the use of AI reduced perceived difficulty, choice satisfaction remained unchanged, suggesting that autonomy in decision making was preserved. These findings indicate that generative AI can support everyday decision making by compensating for the constraints in information search that older adults face due to cognitive decline."}

We ask LLM-driven agents to grow a network by informing them about current link constellations. Our observations confirm that agents consistently apply a preferential attachment mechanism, favoring connections to nodes with higher degrees. We systematically solicited more than a million decisions from four different LLMs, including Gemini, ChatGPT, Llama, and Claude. When social attributes such as age, gender, religion, and political orientation are incorporated, the resulting networks exhibit heightened assortativity, leading to the formation of distinct homophilic communities. This significantly alters the network topology from what would be expected under a pure preferential attachment model alone. Political and religious attributes most significantly fragment the collective, fostering polarized subgroups, while age and gender yield more gradual structural shifts. Strikingly, LLMs also reveal asymmetric patterns in heterophilous ties, suggesting embedded directional biases reflective of societal norms. As autonomous AI agents increasingly shape the architecture of online systems, these findings contribute to how algorithmic choices of generative AI collectives not only reshape network topology, but offer critical insights into how AI-driven systems co-evolve and self-organize."}

This triggers value co-destruction across the creator economy and society, making it particularly crucial to enhance content entrepreneurs\u2019 compliance with GenAI policies. Aiming to develop an effective governance framework, this study adopts a mixed-methods approach, beginning with exploratory interviews to uncover factors affecting GenAI policy compliance intention. Subsequently, it employs confirmatory quantitative research with a survey to validate the proposed research model. The results indicate that both the deterrence triad (i.e., perceived sanction certainty, severity, and celerity) and perceived social norm strengthen GenAI policy compliance intention. Meanwhile, perceived social norm weakens the impact of perceived sanction certainty on policy compliance intention. Furthermore, peer communication enhances policy compliance intention by increasing perceptions of sanction certainty and celerity as well as social norm.

Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject."}

However, up to 50% of their time is spent addressing repetitive patient inquiries, impacting efficiency and patient satisfaction. AI-powered solutions have been explored, but generic AI models lack domain specificity, emotional intelligence, and safety assurances. CHARLI, a constrained AI model trained on validated specialist fertility data, represents an innovative approach to enhancing patient engagement while safeguarding clinical integrity.\n \n \n \n A prospective validation study was conducted to evaluate CHARLI\u2019s responses to 50 fertility-related patient queries over a six-month period. A multidisciplinary team, including fertility specialists, nurses, and general practitioners, assessed responses for accuracy, empathy, and risk using a structured evaluation framework. The study aimed to determine CHARLI\u2019s ability to provide clinically relevant, emotionally intelligent, and safe responses, ensuring its suitability for integration into real-world fertility care settings.\n \n \n \n A multidisciplinary panel of fertility specialists, nurses, and general practitioners developed a standardized set of patient queries reflecting real-world concerns in fertility care. CHARLI\u2019s responses were compared against a leading commercial AI model and evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale for accuracy, empathy, and risk. Language analysis tools (Grammarly, Turnitin) assessed clarity and engagement, while clinical safety checks ensured responses remained appropriate, medically accurate, and free from misleading or harmful content.\n \n \n \n The evaluation of CHARLI\u2019s responses demonstrated its consistent ability to deliver high-quality, contextually appropriate, and empathetic patient interactions, with an average response length of 375 words (range: 200-500). The model outperformed a commercial AI system, showing superior clinical relevance, emotional intelligence, and safety. Importantly, no medically concerning outputs were detected, highlighting the system\u2019s robustness and reliability in a healthcare setting.\n While the results strongly favour CHARLI\u2019s structured AI model, the role of chance must be considered in understanding variability in AI-generated responses. The range in response length (200-500 words) suggests some degree of unpredictability in output, influenced by query complexity, AI training data, and prompt engineering constraints. The absence of concerning medical outputs may reflect rigorous model tuning and validation rather than sheer randomness, yet the risk of unpredictable AI behaviour, known as hallucinations, cannot be completely eliminated.\n Furthermore, response accuracy (mean 4.58/5) and warmth (mean 4.85/5) indicate high consistency, yet human raters may introduce subjectivity in scoring. Prompt engineering played a critical role in minimizing inappropriate or unsafe responses, demonstrating that AI reliability is not purely left to chance but rather shaped by controlled interventions and ongoing refinement to ensure patient safety and trust.\n \n \n \n While CHARLI significantly enhances efficiency by providing timely and accurate responses, it cannot replace the essential human touch in fertility care. The AI lacks the ability to assess patient comprehension, emotional distress, or the complexity of individual cases. Future integration into clinical workflows, real-world validation will be crucial for implementation.\n \n \n \n This study demonstrates that AI can redefine patient engagement in care. CHARLI\u2019s success paves the way for scalable, accessible, and clinically responsible support, reducing healthcare workload while empowering patients with timely, reliable information. Future iterations could extend AI-driven reproductive health support into telehealth, multilingual patient education, and personalized care pathways.\n \n \n \n No\n"}

Computational protein design cannot yet fully mimic nature\u2019s ability to engineer new proteins from existing templates. Protein language models generate informative per-residue representations, but leveraging them to execute large-scale, function-preserving mutations and indels has remained beyond reach. We introduce Raygun, a generative AI framework that unlocks efficient miniaturization, modification, and augmentation of proteins, using a novel probabilistic encoding of protein sequences constructed from language model embeddings. Emulating evolution, Raygun shrinks proteins by 10-25% (sometimes over 50%) while preserving predicted structural integrity and fidelity, introduces extensive sequence diversity while preserving functional sites, and can expand proteins beyond their natural size. These capabilities unlock new opportunities in gene therapy and biotechnology. In cell-based validation, Raygun successfully miniaturized fluorescent proteins, two of which are smaller than 96% of fluorescent proteins reported in FPbase, as well as TurboID, a synthetic biotin ligase widely adopted for proteomics. It also successfully expanded Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), a natural binding partner to the EGFR protein, generating EGF variants with higher binding affinity than the wildtype.

CRM uses music to surveil audiences, removes decision-making responsibilities from consumers, and alters relationships among listeners, artists, and music. DRM overprotects copyrighted content by subverting Fair Use Doctrine and privatizing the Public Domain thereby restricting human creativity. Generative AI, often trained on music misappropriated by developers, renders novel music that seemingly represents neither the artistry present in the training data nor the handiwork of the AI\u2019s user. AI music, as such, appears to be produced through AI cognition, resulting in what some have called \u201cmachine folk\u201d and contributing to a \u201cculture in code.\u201d A philosophical analysis of these relationships is required to fully understand how AI impacts music, artists, and audiences.

It focuses specifically on emissions from onshore and offshore petroleum production operations. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the research aims to develop a robust emissions prediction model to accelerate decarbonization efforts while enhancing sustainability in the energy sector.\n Classical and Advanced AI algorithms and data analytics approaches were applied to interpret emissions data reported in the GHGRP, covering petroleum and natural gas assets from U.S. upstream sector. The approach included machine learning (ML) techniques such as gradient boosting models and deep learning to capture emission patterns and improve prediction accuracy. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were employed to refine data collection processes, extracting insights from regulatory and operational reports. A comprehensive AI-powered framework was designed to identify key emissions sources and forecast potential reductions, providing actionable intelligence for emissions management strategies across operations.\n The study successfully leveraged AI models to forecast GHG emissions across petroleum and natural gas assets. The research identified key areas where emissions were concentrated and predicted future trends with high accuracy. Machine learning models, particularly boosting techniques, outperformed traditional statistical approaches, providing superior results in emissions forecasting at both the equipment and system-wide levels. This methodology highlighted significant sources of emissions within this sector and pinpointed where mitigation efforts could yield the greatest impact.\n Generative AI Large Language Models (LLM) enhanced the capability to process small or large GHG datasets. The hybrid multi-model approach demonstrated a novel use case for processing environmental data, ensuring efficient, accurate analysis across multiple sources. The findings underscore the value of AI in emissions reduction strategies, offering vital insights for energy industry leaders and regulators. The models can be adapted to broader applications, helping the industry reduce its environmental footprint.\n This study introduces a first-of-its-kind approach that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to forecast emissions from U.S. production assets, leveraging open GHGRP data from petroleum and natural gas production facilities. It integrates Generative AI, marking a cutting-edge application and a valuable contribution to the petroleum industry. By establishing a repeatable ML forecasting framework and ensemble of models, this applied research helps the energy industry set an industry baseline for emissions, enabling continuous improvements and precise target setting for emissions efficiency and neutrality. This pioneering effort not only complements existing methodologies for natural gas compression, transmission, and storage but also positions the study at the forefront of industry advancements in achieving carbon emissions management through applications of advanced technologies.

Methods: Six engineered prompts were provided to Decoder-Only Autoregressive Language and Image Synthesis 3 (DALL-E 3) and Medical Illustration Manager (MIM) to guide these generative AI models in creating a final medical illustration for each of the four corneal transplant procedures. Control illustrations were created by the authors for each transplant technique for comparison. A grading system with five categories with a maximum score of 3 points each (15 points total) was designed to objectively assess AI's performance. Four independent reviewers analyzed and scored the final images produced by DALL-E 3 and MIM as well as the control illustrations. All AI-generated images and control illustrations were then provided to Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-4o (ChatGPT-4o), which was tasked with grading each image with the grading system described above. All results were then tabulated and graphically depicted. Results: The control illustration images received significantly higher scores than produced images from DALL-E 3 and MIM in legibility, anatomical realism and accuracy, procedural step accuracy, and lack of fictitious anatomy (p<0.001). For detail and clarity, the control illustrations and images produced by DALL-E 3 and MIM received statistically similar scores of 2.75\u00b10.29, 2.19\u00b10.24, and 2.50\u00b10.29, respectively (p=0.0504). With regard to mean cumulative scores for each transplant procedure image, the control illustrations received a significantly higher score than DALL-E 3 and MIM (p<0.001). Additionally, the overall mean cumulative score for the control illustrations was significantly higher than DALL-E 3 and MIM (14.56\u00b10.51 (97.1%), 4.38\u00b11.2 (29.2%), and 5.63\u00b11.82 (37.5%), respectively (p<0.001)). When assessing AI's grading performance, ChatGPT-4o scored the images produced by DALL-E 3 and MIM significantly higher than the average scores of the independent reviewers (DALL-E 3: 10.0\u00b10.0 (66.6%) vs. 4.38\u00b11.20 (29.2%), p<0.001; MIM: 10.0\u00b10.0 (66.6%) vs. 5.63\u00b11.82 (37.5%), p<0.001). However, mean scores for the control illustrations between ChatGPT-4o and the independent reviewers were comparable (15.0\u00b10.0 (100%) vs. 14.56\u00b10.13 (97.1%); p>0.05). Conclusion: AI is an extremely powerful and efficient tool for many tasks, but it is currently limited in producing accurate medical illustrations for corneal transplant procedures. Further development is required for generative AI models to create medically sound and accurate illustrations for use in ophthalmology."}

The study explores the attitudes of Ukrainian teachers and students towards generative artificial intelligence tools in the context of English language teaching and learning. The topicality of the research stems from the accelerated adoption of online educational tools in Ukraine due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The study aims to explore how these circumstances have shaped perceptions of generative artificial intelligence and influenced its use in education. An online survey conducted in April 2024 collected data from 683 participants, including English language teachers, university students, and senior school learners from several Ukrainian regions. The results of the survey reveal a primarily positive attitude to artificial intelligence among both teachers and students, although students show a significantly higher level of positivity. The learners\u2019 familiarity with such technologies and their integration into students\u2019 daily lives may contribute to this positive outlook, while the teachers exhibit more caution due to concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on traditional teaching methods. The study highlights common concerns about artificial intelligence tools, including generated data reliability issues, the risks of violating academic integrity and undermining critical thinking, Despite these drawbacks, their perceived benefits, such as the ability to generate educational materials quickly and provide instant answers, are valued by both groups. The author emphasises the need for tailored integration strategies that address the specific context of Ukrainian education. Recommendations based on the survey results include conducting training sessions on the use of artificial intelligence tools for educators, creating clear ethical guidelines on the use of generative artificial intelligence at different educational levels, and developing assignments which are resistant to generative artificial intelligence responses in order to enhance students\u2019 critical thinking."}

Organizations often rely on user-created content, such as reviews, opinions, and tweets, to assess product launch success, as well as engage in continuous monitoring of customer sentiments. However, the manual screening of this gargantuan amount of information is ineffective and could lead to delayed understandings, thus making the process more complex. It is crucial for businesses to respond to public opinion in a timely manner. This project presents a method that is designed to make the process automatic. Social media sentiment analysis for product performance evaluation by allowing product owners to input a brand designation, the tool fetches recent entries or comments from social media sites and performs a sentiment analysis to classify them as positive or negative, or neutral. Along with gathering sentiment outcomes, the tool determines significant concepts associated with both positive and negative provisions observations and derives a summary through a Large Language Model (LLM). The derived information offers product owners an in-depth perception of the attitudes of consumers. The approach will help organizations monitor the perception of the people towards their product launches, make informed decisions, and quickly address favorable and unfavorable feedback. It is designed to make the business competitive with timely consumer satisfaction knowledge, thus enhancing the product and enhancing customer engagement."}

E-maintenance as a leading concept for maintenance management has so far primarily involved the use of domain-specific technical language processing (TLP) techniques on historical case data. Due to its popularity, generative AI (GAI) with large language models (LLMs) is starting to be used more and more in various technical areas, thus starting to take an increasingly important place in diagnostics and maintenance. Starting from the fact that the rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT) was the main factor in the emergence and development of the concept of e-maintenance, the importance of the potential more serious application of all forms of generative AI in the context is clear. This is especially pronounced in cases of difficult or impossible access to the location of components or an uncertain situation related to the type of process (e.g., nuclear, aeronautical, space, offshore). Autonomous vehicles, vessels, and aircraft (as an indispensable part of today\u2019s intelligent transport systems) are certainly a leading example of these cases. Regardless of the level of autonomy, these systems are extremely complex and difficult to maintain and represent a clear challenge for the application of new approaches. Therefore, the authors of the paper propose the use of middleware that would enable the integration of various GAI tools, algorithms, and models to increase the effectiveness of diagnostics and maintenance as close as possible to real-time. However, the exact extent of the possibilities and limitations of this approach has yet to be determined."}

Therefore, attention was centered on faculty and addressing their primary concerns of students and student learning, rather than programs and aggregating and reporting of assessment results. To foster the perception and achieve assessment adjustments needed, one practical and effective core component of Program Theory (PT) and Implementation Fidelity (IF), which centers on student learning, was presented and encouraged for broader assessment use. Because PT and IF are typically presented as research in assessment and instructional literature, modifications to the processes were essential due to their resource intensity. Both PT and IF can be facilitated with Generative AI, which was discussed as an effective resource for researching beneficial strategies and analyzing often underused qualitative learning evidence. Finally, Learning Organization literature was offered as guidance for cultivating a learning organization within a subset of the larger institution. For example, the importance of time and space for faculty to reflect on these approaches, and encouragement from supportive leaders, especially when learning about and applying new or revised approaches, were stressed in the workshop.

In this paper, we focus on diffusion models, a powerful generative AI technology, and investigate their potential for black-box optimization over complex structured variables. Consider the practical scenario where one wants to optimize some structured design in a high-dimensional space, based on massive unlabeled data (representing design variables) and a small labeled dataset. We study two practical types of labels: 1) noisy measurements of a real-valued reward function and 2) human preference based on pairwise comparisons. The goal is to generate new designs that are near-optimal and preserve the designed latent structures. Our proposed method reformulates the design optimization problem into a conditional sampling problem, which allows us to leverage the power of diffusion models for modeling complex distributions. In particular, we propose a reward-directed conditional diffusion model, to be trained on the mixed data, for sampling a near-optimal solution conditioned on high predicted rewards. Theoretically, we establish sub-optimality error bounds for the generated designs. The sub-optimality gap nearly matches the optimal guarantee in off-policy bandits, demonstrating the efficiency of reward-directed diffusion models for black-box optimization. Moreover, when the data admits a low-dimensional latent subspace structure, our model efficiently generates high-fidelity designs that closely respect the latent structure. We provide empirical experiments validating our model in decision-making and content-creation tasks."}

Our hypotheses were supported by a field experiment, in which we randomly assigned employees in a technology consulting firm to either receive LLM assistance or not. The results are robust across both supervisor and external evaluator ratings of employee creativity. Our findings indicate that LLM assistance enhances employees' creativity by providing cognitive job resources, especially for employees with high (vs. low) levels of metacognitive strategies. Overall, our field experiment offers novel insights into the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking LLM assistance and employee creativity in the workplace.

Previous studies have evaluated AI performance on medical license examinations, primarily focusing on ChatGPT. However, the availability of new online chat-based large language models (OC-LLMs) and their potential utility in pharmacy licensing examinations remain underexplored. Considering that pharmacists require a broad range of expertise in physics, chemistry, biology, and pharmacology, verifying the knowledge base and problem-solving abilities of these new models in Japanese pharmacy examinations is necessary. Objective This study aimed to assess the performance of 18 OC-LLMs released in 2024 in the 107th Japanese National License Examination for Pharmacists (JNLEP). Specifically, the study compared their accuracy and identified areas of improvement relative to earlier models. Methods The 107th JNLEP, comprising 345 questions in Japanese, was used as a benchmark. Each OC-LLM was prompted by the original text-based questions, and images were uploaded where permitted. No additional prompt engineering or English translation was performed. For questions that included diagrams or chemical structures, the models incapable of image input were considered incorrect. The model outputs were compared with publicly available correct answers. The overall accuracy rates were calculated based on subject area (pharmacology and chemistry) and question type (text-only, diagram-based, calculation, and chemical structure). Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba was used to measure answer consistency among the top-performing models. Results Four flagship models\u2014ChatGPT o1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new), and Perplexity Pro\u2014achieved 80% accuracy, surpassing the official passing threshold and average examinee score. A significant improvement in the overall accuracy was observed between the early and the latest 2024 models. Marked improvements were noted in text-only and diagram-based questions compared with those of earlier versions. However, the accuracy of chemistry-related and chemical structure questions remains relatively low. Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba among the 4 flagship models was 0.334, which suggests moderate consistency but highlights variability in more complex questions. Conclusions OC-LLMs have substantially improved their capacity to handle Japanese pharmacists\u2019 examination content, with several newer models achieving accuracy rates of >80%. Despite these advancements, even the best-performing models exhibit an error rate exceeding 10%, underscoring the ongoing need for careful human oversight in clinical settings. Overall, the 107th JNLEP will serve as a valuable benchmark for current and future generative AI evaluations in pharmacy licensing examinations."}

While simple 2D orb webs can easily be mimicked, the modeling and synthesis of 3D-based web structures remain challenging, partly due to the rich set of design features. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the heterogenous graph structures of spider webs, and use deep learning as a way to model and then synthesize artificial, bio-inspired 3D web structures. The generative AI models are conditioned based on key geometric parameters (including average edge length, number of nodes, average node degree, and others). To identify graph construction principles, we use inductive representation sampling of large experimentally determined spider web graphs, to yield a dataset that is used to train three conditional generative models: 1) An analog diffusion model inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with sparse neighbor representation, 2) a discrete diffusion model with full neighbor representation, and 3) an autoregressive transformer architecture with full neighbor representation. All three models are scalable, produce complex, de novo bio-inspired spider web mimics, and successfully construct graphs that meet the design objectives. We further propose algorithm that assembles web samples produced by the generative models into larger-scale structures based on a series of geometric design targets, including helical and parametric shapes, mimicking, and extending natural design principles towards integration with diverging engineering objectives. Several webs are manufactured using 3D printing and tested to assess mechanical properties."}

This study evaluated GPT-4\u2019s ability to interpret emergency medicine board exam questions, both text- and image-based, to assess its cognitive and decision-making performance in emergency settings. Methods: An observational study was conducted using Taiwan Emergency Medicine Board Exam questions (2018-2022). GPT-4\u2019s performance was assessed in terms of accuracy and reasoning across question types. Statistical analyses examined factors influencing performance, including knowledge dimension, cognitive level, clinical vignette presence, and question polarity. Results: GPT-4 achieved an overall accuracy of 60.1%, with similar results on text-based (60.2%) and image-based questions (59.3%). It showed perfect accuracy in identifying image types (100%) and high proficiency in interpreting findings (86.4%). However, accuracy declined in diagnostic reasoning (83.1%) and further dropped in final decision-making (59.3%). This stepwise decrease highlights GPT-4\u2019s difficulty integrating image analysis into clinical conclusions. No significant associations were found between question characteristics and AI performance. Conclusion: GPT-4 demonstrates strong image recognition and moderate diagnostic reasoning but limited decision-making capabilities, especially when synthesizing visual and clinical data. Although promising as a training tool, its reliance on pattern recognition over clinical understanding restricts real-world applicability. Further refinement is needed before AI can reliably support emergency medical decisions."}

Findings indicate that while larger datasets and more advanced architectures significantly improve model accuracy and adaptability, they also demand higher computational resources. Additionally, the study addresses key challenges, including model bias, hallucinations, and ethical considerations, while exploring potential strategies for optimization in real-world scenarios. These insights contribute to shaping the future of GenAI-powered Conversational AI, underscoring the importance of scalability, efficiency, and ethical AI practices. By proposing innovative approaches to enhance language comprehension, user interaction, and AI deployment, this research advances the field and supports the development of more robust and responsible AI systems."}

It grapples with supply chains, business processes, marketing, churn, fraud, and money laundering, all while maintaining compliance with the various regulatory frameworks it is beholden to. Due to the sheer volume of wealth being handled by the financial industry and its critical role in everyday life, it has been a lucrative target for a wide spectrum of ever-evolving bad actors. With each successive iteration of this workshop, we have attempted to capture the breadth of these actors - fraudsters, money launderers, market manipulators, and potentially nation-state-level risks. The emerging advances in Generative AI make this a particularly exciting time to host this workshop. GenAI offers groundbreaking approaches to handling the various data types prevalent in the financial sector. From a security point of view, bad actors are actively using Generative AI creatively to thwart conventional defenses (e.g. voice cloning, better synthetic identities), and this workshop's audience would benefit from commonly applicable defenses & best practices against such threats. Last but not the least, there is now an increasing willingness from the financial industry towards deeper engagement and data sharing with academia."}

To encourage adoption of electric vehicles, there is a need for reliable evidence about pricing in pub-lic charging stations that can serve a greater number of communities. However, user-entered pricing information by thousands of charge point operators (CPOs) has created ambiguity for large-scale aggregation, increasing both the cost of analysis for researchers and search costs for consumers. In this paper, we use large language models to address standing challenges with price discovery in distributed digital data. We show that generative AI models can effectively extract pricing mechanisms from unstructured text with high accuracy, and at substantially lower cost of three to four orders of magnitude lower than human curation (USD 0.006 pennies per observation). We exploit the few-shot learning capabilities of GPT-4 with human-in-the-loop feedback\u2014beating prior classification performance benchmarks with fewer training data. The most common pricing models include free, energy-based (per kWh), and time-based (per unit time), with tiered pricing (variable pricing based on usage) being the most prevalent among paid stations. Behavioral insights from a US nationally representative sample of 13,008 stations suggest that EV users are commonly frustrated with the slower than expected charging rates and the total cost of charging. This study uncovers additional consumer barriers to charging services concerning the need for better price standardization."}

However, furthermore, particularly in recent aquaphotomics-oriented scientific fields, effectively categorizing theses datasets using diverse system-based methodologies is essential. Aquaphotomics, a subfield of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), has been extensively explored to investigate water-related spectral properties. However, research integrating AI-driven analytical techniques, particularly for human-related datasets, remains limited. In the fields related to aquaphotomics, to date, little to no research has been conducted on utilizing AI including Large language Models (LLM)-based technologies to process and analyze multiple datasets from human subjects. This study seeks to bridge this gap by employing Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)- 4o to process and interpret aquaphotomics data, thereby facilitating more effective and comprehensive clustering into moisture content variations in human skin. Specifically, we divide subjects into four groups based on their skin moisture content and the ratio of epidermal water loss datasets. We then ask, based on the subjects\u2019 basic information, skin care habits, and lifestyle information concerning exercise, sleep, etc., \u201cWhich group should we predict that any given, new subject will belong to?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the probability that those predictions are correct?\u201d We also specify the process of making those predictions. By presenting this set of analytical data in numerical form to both the user and the esthetic salon, we hope that both the user and the esthetic salon will be able to make informed and satisfactory decisions regarding skin care routines, etc. This includes selecting appropriate serums and supplements, which should improve both the accuracy and effectiveness of skin care choices. In the long term, we anticipate that this research will contribute to the development of generative AI applications in skin care science, which is still evolving."}

By foregrounding the metaphor of \u201cthe moon and the ghetto\u201d (Nelson, 1977, 2011), the issue invites contributions that interrogate the gap between technological capability and institutional justice. The purpose is to foster a multidisciplinary dialogue\u2013spanning applied economics, public policy, AI ethics and urban governance \u2013 that can inform trustworthy, inclusive and democratically grounded AI practices. Contributors are encouraged to explore not just what GenAI can do, but for whom, how and with what consequences.\n \n \n \n This study draws upon interdisciplinary literature from public policy, innovation studies, digital governance and urban sociology to frame the emerging governance challenges of Generative AI and Urban AI. It builds a conceptual foundation by synthesizing insights from comparative city case studies, innovation systems theory and normative policy frameworks. The approach is interpretive and exploratory, aiming to situate AI technologies within broader institutional, geopolitical and socio-economic contexts. The study invites contributions that adopt empirical, theoretical or practice-based methodologies addressing the governance of GenAI in cities and regions.\n \n \n \n This study identifies a critical gap between the rapid technological advancements in Generative AI and the institutional readiness of public governance systems \u2013 particularly in urban contexts. It finds that current policy frameworks often prioritize efficiency and innovationism over democratic legitimacy, civic trust and inclusive design. Drawing on comparative global city experiences, it highlights the risk of reinforcing power asymmetries without robust accountability mechanisms. The analysis suggests that trustworthy AI is not a purely technical attribute but a political and institutional achievement, requiring participatory governance architectures and innovation systems grounded in public value and civic engagement.\n \n \n \n As an editorial introduction, this study does not present original empirical data but synthesizes key theoretical frameworks, case studies and policy debates to guide future research. Its analytical scope is conceptual and comparative, offering a foundation for submissions that further investigate Generative and Urban AI through empirical, normative and practice-based lenses. The limitations lie in its broad coverage and reliance on secondary sources. Nonetheless, it provides an agenda-setting contribution by highlighting the urgent need for interdisciplinary research into how AI reshapes public governance, institutional legitimacy and urban democratic futures.\n \n \n \n This editorial offers a structured framework for policymakers, urban planners, technologists and public administrators to critically assess the governance of Generative and Urban AI systems. By highlighting international case studies and conceptual tools \u2013 such as public algorithmic infrastructures, civic trust frameworks and anticipatory governance \u2013 the article underscores the importance of institutional design, regulatory foresight and civic engagement. It invites practitioners to shift from techno-solutionist approaches toward inclusive, democratic and place-based AI governance. The reflections aim to support the development of trustworthy AI policies that are grounded in legitimacy, accountability and societal needs, particularly in urban and regional contexts.\n \n \n \n The editorial underscores that Generative and Urban AI systems are not socially neutral but carry significant implications for equity, representation and democratic legitimacy. These technologies risk reinforcing existing social hierarchies and systemic biases if not governed inclusively. This study calls for reimagining trust not as a technical feature but as a relational, contested dynamic between institutions and citizens. It encourages submissions that examine how AI reshapes the urban social contract, affects marginalized communities and challenges existing civic infrastructures. The goal is to promote AI governance frameworks that are pluralistic, just and reflective of diverse societal values and lived experiences.\n \n \n \n This editorial offers a timely and conceptually grounded intervention into the emerging field of Urban AI and Generative AI governance. By framing the challenges through Richard R. Nelson\u2019s metaphor of The Moon and the Ghetto, this study foregrounds the gap between technical capabilities and enduring societal injustices. The contribution lies in its interdisciplinary synthesis \u2013 bridging innovation systems, AI ethics, public policy and urban governance.

As these models become increasingly available to the public, concerns arise about perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases in applications. Gender stereotypes can be harmful and limiting for the individuals they target, whether they consist of misrepresentation or discrimination. Recognizing gender bias as a pervasive societal construct, this paper studies how to uncover and quantify the presence of gender biases in generative language models. In particular, we derive generative AI analogues of three well-known non-discrimination criteria from classification, namely independence, separation and sufficiency. To demonstrate these criteria in action, we design prompts for each of the criteria with a focus on occupational gender stereotype, specifically utilizing the medical test to introduce the ground truth in the generative AI context. Our results address the presence of occupational gender bias within such conversational language models."}

This approach is favorable in the context of brain disorders, which are often heterogeneous in their pathophysiological features, patterns of disease progression and treatment response, resulting in limited therapeutic standard-of-care. Here we highlight the transformative role that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural models are poised to play in advancing precision medicine for brain disorders, particularly emerging innovations that improve the relevance of hiPSC models to human physiology. hiPSCs derived from accessible patient somatic cells can produce various neural cell types and tissues; current efforts to increase the complexity of these models, incorporating region-specific neural tissues and non-neural cell types of the brain microenvironment, are providing increasingly relevant insights into human-specific neurobiology. Continued advances in tissue engineering combined with innovations in genomics, high-throughput screening and imaging strengthen the physiological relevance of hiPSC models and thus their ability to uncover disease mechanisms, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and tissue and fluid-based biomarkers that will have real impact on neurological disease treatment. True physiological understanding, however, necessitates integration of hiPSC-neural models with patient biophysical data, including quantitative neuroimaging representations. We discuss recent innovations in cellular neuroscience that can provide these direct connections through generative AI modeling. Our focus is to highlight the great potential of synergy between these emerging innovations to pave the way for personalized medicine becoming a viable option for patients suffering from neuropathologies, particularly rare epileptic and neurodegenerative disorders."}

Quantitative data were gathered through a TAM-based questionnaire tailored to the features of Gen-AI MagicSchool, while qualitative insights were obtained via focus group interviews. The questionnaire assessed teachers\u2019 perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Focus groups explored nuanced factors influencing acceptance or hesitation.

It now forms the primary source of information for decision-making input for a growing segment of the population. Furthermore it may also play an important role in forming a world view, influencing political beliefs and fermenting violent behaviour in some. Credible evidence exists that individuals, state actors and non-state actors, are creating, modifying or promoting information available on the Internet to advance their own agendas. This includes mis-information, dis-information and bias caused by valid information used in the wrong way or at the wrong time, and results in the weaponisation of the Internet. Governments and regulators urgently require tools to detect when the internet is being weaponised, assess its effect on citizens, and ultimately to either prevent or to counter the threat that this causes. This paper proposes a novel framework to model the weaponisation of the internet from a population statistic sense \u2013 the level of understanding that regulators and governments will operate at. The model considers threat actors who cause threats that are propagated to targets within a susceptible population over Internet channels. It includes models for the susceptibility and the response of population entities to threats, and the particular cases of amplified or passed-on threats. Echo chambers, the result of an amplification loop, are considered, as are the use of generative AI tools such as modified large language models as both threat originators and threat recipients."}

For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics\u2014the reap logic and the differentiation logic\u2014that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms."}

This proposal deviates from the traditional multimedia ecosystem, completely relying on in-house production, by shifting part of the content creation onto the receiver. We bring a semantic process into the framework, allowing the distribution network to provide service elements that prompt the content generator rather than distributing encoded data of fully finished programs. The service elements include fine-tailored text descriptions, lightweight image data of some objects, or application programming interfaces, comprehensively referred to as semantic sources, and the user terminal translates the received semantic data into video frames. Empowered by the random nature of generative AI, users can experience super-personalized services accordingly. The proposed idea incorporates situations in which the user receives different service providers\u2019 element packages, either in a sequence over time or multiple packages at the same time. Given promised in-context coherence and content integrity, the combinatory dynamics will amplify the service diversity, allowing the users to always chance upon new experiences. This work particularly aims at short-form videos and advertisements, which the users would easily feel fatigued by seeing the same frame sequence every time. In those use cases, the content provider\u2019s role will be recast as scripting semantic sources, transformed from a thorough producer. Overall, this work explores a new form of media ecosystem facilitated by receiver-embedded generative models, featuring both random content dynamics and enhanced delivery efficiency simultaneously."}

The argument of this article is based on the analysis of two cases: the deployment of an infinite production model in the media industry, particularly Hollywood; and the implementation of an infinite experience of approaching digital media, especially social media and streaming platforms. The essay maintains that the development of this clearly observable paradigm in media has granted the current possibility of having effectively infinite media and suggests that this propensity towards infinity in media could increase through the implementation of resources such as those offered by generative AI."}

We analyzed 295 comments from three Reddit threads discussing vaccination using multiple measurements with different ChatGPT model versions (4o and 4.5). Each comment was contextually paired with its parent comment to capture argumentative stance, and analysis was enhanced by including a preliminary qualitative thematic evaluation. Our findings show moderate-to-strong consistency across measurements, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.64 to 0.77. However, there is variability in interpreting nuanced arguments, such as attributing disease reduction solely to sanitation rather than vaccination, or distinguishing between rhetorical style and genuine argumentative extremism. These variations point to deeper interpretive ambiguities that current generative AI models handle inconsistently. We discuss both the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for qualitative and quantitative content analysis, emphasizing the importance of careful prompt design and methodological transparency. Our findings contribute to advancing AI -assisted research methods in sociology and computational social science, showing pathways to enhance the reliability and interpretive precision of generative thematic analysis."}

However, existing approaches are often constrained to specific exam formats, lack interpretability in score assignment, and struggle with real-world applicability across diverse subjects and assessment types. To address these limitations, we introduce RATAS (Rubric Automated Tree-based Answer Scoring), a novel framework that leverages state-of-the-art generative AI models for rubric-based grading of textual responses. RATAS is designed to support a wide range of grading rubrics, enable subject-agnostic evaluation, and generate structured, explainable rationales for assigned scores. We formalize the automatic grading task through a mathematical framework tailored to rubric-based assessment and present an architecture capable of handling complex, real-world exam structures. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we construct a unique, contextualized dataset derived from real-world project-based courses, encompassing diverse response formats and varying levels of complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that RATAS achieves high reliability and accuracy in automated grading while providing interpretable feedback that enhances transparency for both students and nstructors."}

This study examines the effects of Problem scaffolding-supported Smart Learning Companion (SLC) on the educational dialog model and students' TPACK competency development from an instructional design task, combined with Epistemic network analysis techniques. It was found that Problem scaffolding effectively stimulated students' critical thinking and significantly increased questioning, reasoning, and perspective construction behaviors in conversations compared to no scaffolding support; while conversations without scaffolding mainly stayed at the shallow level of information exchange. This study provides methodological innovations and practical insights into the design of dialogue scaffolding for educational AI, which can be used in the future to develop an intelligent scaffolding adaptive system by combining multimodal data and adaptive technologies to further optimize deep learning paths in human-computer collaboration."}

With these GenAI tools increasingly entering the creative workflows, users' perceptions and motivations for technology adoption need to be understood. The aim of this research is to conduct a systematic review of literature that identifies user motivation alongside significant acceptance factors determining the use of generative AI for media-related work. This particular study reviewed 40 peer-reviewed articles published from 2018 until 2024. The results indicate that motivating factors for the use of GenAI include increased productivity, enhanced creativity, generation of personalized content, and ease of use. Conversely, acceptance depends largely on perceived usefulness, content quality, trust, and transparency. Hindrances on the contrary consist of fears of job loss, ethical issues, content homogenization, and intellectual property rights (IP). As described in the study, GenAI is mostly perceived as an aid that facilitates human creativity rather than something that substitutes it. However, acceptance varies with the ethical measures one has in place and the level of trust given by the users. This paper integrates a significant amount of literature and outlines ways to foster responsible and user-centered deployment of generative AI within the media industries. The main contribution of this study lies in providing a synthesized thematic framework that captures user motivation, acceptance factors, and concerns, offering insights to developers, media professionals, and policymakers for designing more ethically aligned and user-oriented GenAI tools"}

With their greater capabilities to generate realistic and creative content, these T2I models like DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagen or Stable Diffusion are reaching ever wider audiences. Any unsafe behaviors inherited from pretraining on uncurated internet-scraped datasets thus have the potential to cause wide-reaching harm, for example, through generated images which are violent, sexually explicit, or contain biased and derogatory stereotypes. Despite this risk of harm, we lack systematic and structured evaluation datasets to scrutinize model behavior, especially adversarial attacks that bypass existing safety filters. A typical bottleneck in safety evaluation is achieving a wide coverage of different types of challenging examples in the evaluation set, i.e., identifying 'unknown unknowns' or long-tail problems. To address this need, we introduce the Adversarial Nibbler challenge. The goal of this challenge is to crowdsource a diverse set of failure modes and reward challenge participants for successfully finding safety vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art T2I models. Ultimately, we aim to provide greater awareness of these issues and assist developers in improving the future safety and reliability of generative AI models.

Current detectors, such as GPT-Zero, struggle to identify modified AI-generated texts and show reduced reliability for English as a Second Language learners. This study investigates detection of academic cheating by use of generative AI in high-stakes writing assessments. Classical machine learning models, including logistic regression, XGBoost, and support vector machine, are used to distinguish between AI-generated and student-written essays. Additionally, large language models including BERT, RoBERTa, and Electra are examined and compared to traditional machine learning models. The analysis focuses on prompt 1 from the ASAP Kaggle competition. To evaluate the effectiveness of various detection methods and generative AI models, we include ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in their base, pro, and latest versions. Furthermore, we examine the impact of paraphrasing tools such as GPT-Humanizer and QuillBot and introduce a new method of using synonym information to detect humanized AI texts. Additionally, the relationship between dataset size and model performance is explored to inform data collection in future research."}

It maps the relationship between AI personalized solutions and psychological substrates to illustrate how and why AI is an effective way to promote inclusion. Consideration of psychological infrastructure and the skills that support effective learning highlights the importance of individual differences and reminds us that diversity is present in all students, not only those with disabilities. Learner profiles are variable, and the application of a psychological lens provides a way to conceptualise and operationalise this variability by utilising the concept of psychological barriers and enablers. Psychological attributes such as working memory, executive function, metacognition, self-esteem and motivation can influence learning in a positive or negative manner depending on the degree to which they are present; for example, low working memory capacity is a barrier, but high capacity is an enabler. This variability allows them to be targeted and developed. Human intelligence, unlike artificial intelligence, is psychologically constrained, so AI personalisation must be psychologically informed to maximise its educational and inclusive potential."}

KGs parsed from documents may comprise explicit connections (those directly stated by a document) but miss implicit connections (those obvious to a human although not directly stated). To address these challenges, this preliminary research introduces the GAME-KG framework, standing for\"Gaming for Augmenting Metadata and Enhancing Knowledge Graphs.\"GAME-KG is a federated approach to modifying explicit as well as implicit connections in KGs by using crowdsourced feedback collected through video games. GAME-KG is shown through two demonstrations: a Unity test scenario from Dark Shadows, a video game that collects feedback on KGs parsed from US Department of Justice (DOJ) Press Releases on human trafficking, and a following experiment where OpenAI's GPT-4 is prompted to answer questions based on a modified and unmodified KG. Initial results suggest that GAME-KG can be an effective framework for enhancing KGs, while simultaneously providing an explainable set of structured facts verified by humans."}

This study proposes a generative-AI-enabled facility layout design, a novel paradigm aligning with Industry 4.0, to address these challenges by integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI), semantic models, and data-driven optimization. The proposed method evolves from three historical paradigms: experience-based methods, operations research, and simulation-based engineering. The metamodels supporting the generative-AI-enabled facility layout design is the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which digitizes physical assets and their relationships, enabling interoperability across systems. Domain-specific knowledge graphs, constructed by parsing AAS metadata and enriched by large language models (LLMs), capture multifaceted relationships (e.g., spatial adjacency, process dependencies, safety constraints) to guide layout generation. The convolutional knowledge graph embedding (ConvE) method is employed for link prediction, converting entities and relationships into low-dimensional vectors to infer optimal spatial arrangements while addressing data sparsity through negative sampling. The proposed reference architecture for generative-AI-enabled facility layout design supports end-to-end layout design, featuring a 3D visualization engine, AI-driven optimization, and real-time digital twins. Prototype testing demonstrates the system\u2019s end-to-end generation ability from requirement-driven contextual prompts and extensively reduced complexity of modeling, integration, and optimization. Key innovations include the fusion of AAS with LLM-derived contextual knowledge, dynamic adaptation via big data streams, and a hybrid optimization approach balancing competing objectives. The 3D layout generation results demonstrate a scalable, adaptive solution for storage workshops, bridging gaps between isolated data models and human\u2013AI collaboration. This research establishes a foundational framework for AI-driven facility planning, offering actionable insights for AI-enabled facility layout design adoption and highlighting future directions in the generative design of complex engineering."}

A promising solution to curb online hate speech is counterspeech. Counterspeech is aimed at encouraging users to reconsider hateful posts by direct replies. However, current methods lack scalability due to the need for human intervention or fail to adapt to the specific context of the post. A potential remedy is the use of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to write tailored counterspeech messages. In this paper, we analyze whether contextualized counterspeech generated by state-of-the-art LLMs is effective in curbing online hate speech. To do so, we conducted a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment (N=2,664) on the social media platform Twitter/X. Our experiment followed a 2x2 between-subjects design and, additionally, a control condition with no counterspeech. On the one hand, users posting hateful content on Twitter/X were randomly assigned to receive either (a) contextualized counterspeech or (b) non-contextualized counterspeech. Here, the former is generated through LLMs, while the latter relies on predefined, generic messages. On the other hand, we tested two counterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the consequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted their initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the counterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language). We find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a warning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech. However, contextualized counterspeech generated by LLMs proves ineffective and may even backfire."}

Drawing on Gibson\u2019s ecological psychology and Actor-Network Theory, it proposes a \u2018fold diagram\u2019 to illustrate how generative AI fundamentally alters the relationship between users and digital environments. Unlike previous tools requiring user skill for specific outcomes, generative AIs, exemplified by Compton\u2019s generative art toy Idle Hands, procedural content generation, and LLM-based AI chatbots, respond meaningfully even to unintentional actions or underdeveloped queries, facilitating a new trade-off where control is ceded for increased power. The paper argues that affordances are no longer opportunities for action discovered by the user, but rather the machine\u2019s capacity to flesh out predicted user interests. This shift is viewed through the lens of a radical symmetry between human and AI agency, where both actively fold the digital web to create intra-active niches. Ultimately, the paper presents a critical theory of HCI, asserting that software capitalism leverages generative AI to continuously re-world the web, preserving and exploiting pre-individuated user interests for profit."}

Specifically, we examine whether the proliferation of Gen-AI might shift the preferences of high-income groups towards nonmarket insurance and greater income redistribution due to their increased risk of future income loss. Considering the opinion that Gen-AI could be our final invention due to its potential for self-learning and incredible productivity, and recognizing Gen-AI\u2019s disruptive potential for workers performing non-cognitive tasks, we argue that AI-based automation will require new institutional arrangements. These institutional arrangement changes would promote the redistribution of income generated through economic processes with minimal human participation. Such institutional arrangements are largely reflective of the OIE ideas of an economy of abundance and the institutionalization of good work, with the job as a socially constructed institution at its core."}

Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff\u2018s universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV), multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels."}

The findings aim to expand existing research and provide actionable guidance for integrating GAI into practical marketing strategies.\n\n\n\nA sample of 444 participants was recruited through Prolific to complete a survey based on different types of marketing contexts. Then, the dataset created through the survey data is analysed using statistical analysis to test the impact of the anthropomorphism of GAI on consumer behaviour in two marketing communication scenarios: chatbots and promotion advertisements (posters).\n\n\n\nAnthropomorphism enhances purchase intention directly and indirectly through perceived social presence and trust. Transparency, i.e., the disclosure of AI-generated content, weakens the effect of anthropomorphism on social presence, decreasing the impact as transparency increases. Marketing scenarios (chatbot vs poster) influence the strength of these effects, with chatbots amplifying the mediating role of social presence and trust. However, the overall mediation mechanism linking anthropomorphism to purchase intention through social presence and trust remains stable across different communication scenarios and levels of transparency.\n\n\n\nFew studies have comprehensively explored the impact and mechanisms of GAI on multi-faceted consumer behaviour intentions.

It addresses a gap in applied research on how generative AI can be adapted for domain-specific translation workflows, particularly in academic institutions. \nPurpose: \u00a0To design and implement UGRBot, a chatbot based on ChatGPT-4 that supports the translation of institutional texts at the University of Granada (UGR) while also outlining a structured and replicable methodology for creating specialised chatbots to enhance translation processes. \nMethod: The methodology includes: (1) chatbot development using a knowledge base of 57 bilingual institutional documents; (2) evaluation of output quality using BLEU scores, comparing UGRBot with DeepL and Google Translate; and (3) a focused assessment on the translation of 100 institutional terms. \nResults: A reference corpus in English of 14,521 words was compiled from UGR administrative and regulatory documents, with human translations serving as the benchmark. BLEU scores were computed using the Natural Language Toolkit library in Python, employing 4-gram analysis for full-text evaluation and bigram analysis for terminology translation. \nConclusion: Results show that UGRBot outperformed both baseline systems in the translation of specialised institutional terminology, achieving the highest BLEU score in this area. However, limitations include lower performance across full-length texts. In conclusion, this research documents the development of a domain-specific GPTBot and its implementation in an institutional context, offering a transferable framework for integrating generative AI into specialised translation workflows."}

Such a system would encompass all aspects of the customer experience, from presenting the right product value to the right users, to understanding a user's likelihood of conversion and long-term value to the platform, as well as their propensity for cross-selling and risk of churning. Currently, models and algorithms for customer journey optimization are often developed in isolation, leading to inefficiencies in modeling and data pipelines. Furthermore, the customer is often viewed as a collection of different entities by different organizational departments (such as marketing, sales, and finance), which can lead to additional friction in the customer experience. This workshop seeks to bridge the gap between academic researchers and industrial practitioners who are interested in building holistic solutions for end-to-end customer journey optimization.

Instead, it advocates for a renewed culture of academic integrity that incorporates comprehensive AI ethics training across the academic community. This approach goes beyond simplistic prohibitions to address the broader ethical, social, technical, and normative issues that underpin academic integrity in the use of AI tools. By fostering awareness and competence in AI ethics, it seeks to equip students, educators, and administrators with the skills to critically engage with AI technologies, promote fairness, transparency, and accountability, and ensure responsible and ethical use.

The key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments."}

Among these advancements, the concept of digital twins (DTs) has recently gained attention as a tool with substantial transformative potential in different clinical contexts. DTs are virtual representations of a physical entity (e.g., a patient or an organ) or systems (e.g., hospital wards, including laboratories), continuously updated with real-time data to mirror its real-world counterpart. DTs can be utilized to monitor and customize health care by simulating an individual\u2019s health status based on information from wearables, medical devices, diagnostic tests, and electronic health records. In addition, DTs can be used to define personalized treatment plans. In this study, we focused on some possible applications of DTs in laboratory medicine when used with AI and synthetic data obtained by generative AI. The first point discussed how biological variation (BV) application could be tailored to individuals, considering population-derived BV data on laboratory parameters and circadian or ultradian variations. Another application could be enhancing the interpretation of tumor markers in advanced cancer therapy and treatments. Furthermore, DTs applications might derive personalized reference intervals, also considering BV data or they can be used to improve test results interpretation. DT\u2019s widespread adoption in healthcare is not imminent, but it is not far off. This technology will likely offer innovative and definitive solutions for dynamically evaluating treatments and more precise diagnoses for personalized medicine."}

Usually, images are subjected to several inconsistencies, such as noise, blurring, resolution, intensity variations, distortions, etc. Thus, image quality assessment (IQA) and enhancement are imperative for accurate and efficient machine learning models in computer vision applications. This study aims to provide an in-depth review and analysis of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) IQA techniques. Besides, a new taxonomy is presented to classify various IQA techniques, as well as various evaluation protocols (i.e. metrics and benchmark datasets) that are frequently used to assess these methods. However, noteworthy progress has been observed in IQA techniques, but there exist several research challenges in this active field of digital imaging. One of the crucial challenges is to deploy modern deep learning models for IQA and enhancement, as these require comparatively larger datasets. The quality assessment of generative AI-based images is an additional challenge, as they are subjected to several quality issues. Moreover, multi-spectral and super-resolution image quality assessment is another open challenge that requires the attention of investigators in this field of research."}

When trained on validated medical sources and supervised by domain experts, these systems can enhance clinical understanding, support the interpretation of complex cases, and contribute to continuous professional development. Their use is increasingly accepted among specialists as a complement to traditional medical education.\n Aim To describe the development, deployment, and validation of generative AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for delivering domain-specific educational support, with a focus on malignant and benign hematologic disorders.\n Material or patients and method Code Red domain-specific generative AI assistants are developed by physician teams who define a focused medical knowledge domain and curate a closed, validated text corpus. Each assistant operates on OpenAI GPT-4o or GPT-4.1 with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a bespoke system prompt, refined iteratively with subject matter experts. Following public release, integrated voting and comment tools collect real-time user feedback, enabling continuous updates by a medical oversight group. All responses are fully referenced and downloadable as PDF. The platform is natively multimodal, supporting speech input/output, image and PDF parsing, and context-aware reasoning across modalities. These capabilities are designed to enrich advanced medical education, support interpretation of clinical content, and aid in the understanding of complex diagnostic and therapeutic concepts\u2014always under expert supervision and without replacing clinical judgment.\n Results Each Code Red assistant is developed by one to two physicians following a structured review of validated scientific literature and is released only after expert clinical validation. By mid-2025, the platform hosts 230 publicly accessible assistants covering diverse medical domains, freely available through www.codigorojo.tech.\n Hematology represents one of the most developed areas: 22 assistants are dedicated to malignant hematologic conditions, including 10 focused on specific disease entities such as acute leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, multiple myeloma, as well as myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes. Six modules address supportive diagnostic or prognostic domains such as hematological diagnosis, frailty assessment, and immunodeficiency-associated infections. An additional six assistants focus on therapeutic management and associated toxicities, including cell therapy, CAR-T\u2013related complications (CRS, ICANS), tumor lysis syndrome, and cardio-oncology. In benign hematology, 13 assistants are available. Eight of them address disease-specific content such as hemophilia (including gene therapy in hemophilia B), platelet disorders, congenital and acquired coagulopathies, and anemia. The remaining five support transfusion medicine, anticoagulation, massive bleeding management, and interpretation of diagnostic tools such as ROTEM and basic coagulation tests.\n Since the platform's launch in November 2024, the assistant interface (https://chatbot.codigorojo.tech) has registered 273,831 visits. Registered users predominantly connected from Spain (58%), followed by the United States, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Ireland. Access is possible via desktop or mobile, with a dedicated mobile app also available. A significant proportion of users interact anonymously, underscoring the platform's open-access, educational nature and international reach.\n Conclusions Code Red is among the first multimodal generative AI platforms designed specifically for clinical education. Its successful application in hematology underscores the value of domain-specific, expert-supervised systems in advancing specialized medical training. An independent benchmarking process is underway across specialties to assess performance and reliability. Future developments will focus on orchestrating outputs across domains using reasoning-capable agent models and integrating parallel self-evaluation systems to ensure sustained quality and clinical relevance.\n"}

To distinguish between occupations more and less exposed to generative AI, we employed a genetic algorithm that allows group classifications to emerge from observed wage dynamics rather than from predetermined indices. The subsequent difference-in-differences analysis shows that occupations with higher exposure to ChatGPT experienced notably slower wage growth compared with those less exposed, suggesting a widening of existing disparities. The study not only provides new empirical evidence on the labor market consequences of generative AI but also demonstrates the value of combining machine learning with econometric techniques. The findings carry important implications for policy, underscoring the need for reskilling initiatives and other measures to prevent the unequal distribution of AIs economic benefits."}

Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capability, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffusion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high-quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input images. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.

The AI technologies supported individualized and personalized learning from content delivery to feedback provision and progress supervision since the beginning of the 21st century. The pedagogical potential of AI was explored in relation to teaching assistance and personalized learning. Nevertheless, the evolution of generative AI opens the way for misinformation and mystification in the field of education. According to the definition of artificial intelligence, \u201cAI systems are designed to simulate or replicate human cognitive functions and adapt to new information and situations\u201d. Simulating and replicating does not mean replacing. If a few years ago, the biggest fear of a teacher was that the students would take fragments available on the internet, once with the evolution of AI, the biggest threat becomes that the cognitive abilities of the students would not be trained at all. Our study shows how students were challenged to use AI to produce scientific content related to curriculum theories. The results are in line with the international trend that depicts AI as a learning instrument, as an assistant for teaching and learning processes. The prospective teachers enhance that the content provided by an AI generative soft might impress a novice, but not an experienced person. However, they appreciated the design of the delivered content and the speed with which it was proposed."}

However, ensuring the clinical relevance and fidelity of synthetic data remains a critical challenge, requiring rigorous planning and evaluation to avoid introducing clinically irrelevant artefacts. This study presents a robust framework for generating and sensing synthetic parasitic data of lymphatic filariasis, benchmarked against original microscopic data. Specifically, the framework compares synthetic parasites generated using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based models, such as FastGAN. The evaluation methodology employs a multifaceted strategy that integrates explainability and rigorously assesses synthetic data quality across two key dimensions. First, the similarity between real and synthetic parasites is quantified using metrics such as the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Second, the usability of the synthetic data is analyzed by examining deviations in pixel dimensions, optical density and morphological structure integrity between the outputs of the DDPM and GAN models. The framework adopts an ensemble-like evaluation approach, ensuring comprehensive validation of the generative models\u2019 performance. The findings of this study underscore the potential of generative AI in producing high-quality synthetic parasitic data for digital pathology, with significant implications for medical and defence applications with quality assurance.

This integration, however, introduces complex challenges in designing coherent CPPS, particularly as few studies concurrently address the deployment of physical layers and communication connections in the cyber layer. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a framework for robust sensor placement to optimize anomaly detection in the physical layer and enhance communication resilience in the cyber layer. We model the CPPS as an interdependent network via a graph, allowing for simultaneous consideration of both layers. Then, we adopt the Log-normal Shadowing Path Loss (LNSPL) model to ensure reliable data transmission. Additionally, we leverage the Fiedler value to measure graph resilience against line failures and three anomaly detectors to fortify system safety. However, the optimization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we introduce the Experience Feedback Graph Diffusion (EFGD) algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion process to generate optimal sensor placement strategies. This algorithm incorporates cross-entropy gradient and experience feedback mechanisms to expedite convergence and generate higher reward strategies. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the EFGD algorithm enhances model convergence by 18.9% over existing graph diffusion methods and improves average reward by 22.90% compared to Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) and 19.57% compared to Graph Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), thereby significantly bolstering the robustness and reliability of CPPS operations."}

We obtained 566 unique posts about GF from online forums for creative professionals who use Photoshop in their current work practices. We conducted reflexive thematic analysis focusing on usefulness, ease of use, and user values. Users found GF useful in doing touch-ups, expanding images, and generating composite images. GF helped users' values of productivity by making work efficient but created a value tension around creativity: it helped reduce barriers to creativity but hindered distinguishing 'human' from algorithmic art.

The generation of content as well as supporting MBSE users in Development including the supporting SysML, positions GenAI to play an important role in the modeling with MBSE. Work is underway to explore how GenAI can generate the MBSE content and support the end user in providing crucial feedback on the rules and processes involved with MBSE while generating MBSE content. This work tends to show how GenAI along with RAG-based MBSE information can be incorporated into GenAI to serve as an AI agent which supports the development, validation, and documentation of said models.

However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the field of indoor scene understanding and generation."}

This review seeks to fill this gap by reviewing the existing literature over the last three years since GenAI\u2019s emergence, focusing on ethical guidelines in assessment. It also aims to offer policy recommendations to address these issues through this central research question: \u201cWhat ethical guidelines can be established to leverage generative AI in higher education assessment while ensuring academic honesty and reconsidering the concept of academic integrity?\u201d We followed PRISMA to select articles for this literature review. This review revealed that GenAI has greatly impacted assessment in three main ways: disrupting traditional ways of assessment, raising concerns about academic integrity and ethics, and necessitating the urgent need for a clear ethical framework for the responsible and productive usage of GenAI in the higher education context. This review also offers four critical insights into the existing research on policies: advocate for assessment strategies in adapting policies to encourage the ethical usage of GenAI, consider that reliance on AI detectors is inadequate, reconsider \u2018originality\u2019 and \u2018academic integrity\u2019 in the context of the GenAI era, and suggest frameworks to establish ethical guidance."}

As new regimes of digital regulation take shape, questions about their legitimacy are likely to become ever more central. Focusing on the model of independent regulation favoured in liberal democracies, this article notes that the general problems of legitimacy regulators faces may be aggravated in the case of digital regulation, since the factors believed to make regulation effective (technical expertise, agility, adaptability and collaborative relations with industry) widen the gap between regulators and democratic publics and increase the likelihood of \u2018capture\u2019 by powerful stakeholders and ideologies. Rejecting both technocratic and populist\u2010decisionist responses to these legitimation problems, the article draws instead on work that rethinks regulation along more deliberative democratic lines. To improve the legitimacy of digital regulation, the focus should be on increasing the quality of justification between regulators and their publics, ensuring not just that those involved in regulation justify their decisions to those they affect and are supposed to serve, but that members of the public are empowered to reflect on, test and contribute to shaping these justifications."}

Consequently, traditional approaches to misinformation detection and intervention have become inadequate in this evolving landscape. This paper explores the challenges posed by AIGC in the context of misinformation. It examines the issue from psychological and societal perspectives, and explores the subtle manipulation traces found in AIGC at signal, perceptual, semantic, and human levels. By scrutinizing manipulation traces such as signal manipulation, semantic inconsistencies, logical incoherence, and psychological strategies, our objective is to tackle AI-generated misinformation and provide a conceptual design of systematic explainable solution.

The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation.

This is demonstrated with regard to the symbol grounding problem in AI by considering that meaning is not the outcome of a two-way relation between an object and a brain (or AI) but of the negotiation of meaning in the triadic relation between objects, symbols, and human practices. This is common in the interpretive social research tradition of the humanities. We argue that AI benefits from embedding generative methods in interpretive social research methodologies. This can be achieved by using the example of the recently developed methodology of interpretive agent-based simulation (iABM). This methodology enables the generation of counterfactual narratives anchored in ethnographic evidence and hermeneutically interpreted, producing symbolically grounded and plausible futures.

These prompts can provide context and direction to a conversation by telling the application what to pay attention to and what the desired output should look like. In this paper, readers will learn what prompt engineering is and why it is relevant to experiential learning design. A simple prompt pattern is used to guide the phrasing of prompts for three examples: designing a debrief script for a simulation, creating reflection questions for a service-learning experience, and using generative AI as a learning partner/tutor. The goal is to ignite the imagination of the readers for how they might design their own prompts to be more efficient and effective in their experiential learning design efforts."}

The blockade of the Ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel plays a critical role in cardiac repolarization. Computational predictions of hERG inhibition can help foresee drug safety, but current data-driven approaches have limitations. Therefore, a new paradigm that bridges the gap between data and knowledge offers an alternative for advancing precision pharmacogenomics in assessing hERG cardiotoxicity. This study aims to develop a reasoning-based, in-silico, robust model for predicting drug-induced hERG inhibition, facilitating new drug development by reducing time and cost, and supporting downstream in-vitro and in-vivo testing. In this study, we constructed a new dataset (UnihERG_DB) by sourcing data from ChEMBL, PubChem, BindingDB, hERG Karim's, hERG Blocker's, and GTP bioactivity databases. The final dataset comprises 20,409 SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) data samples, labeled as hERG blockers (IC50 < 10 \u03bcM) or non-hERG blockers (IC50 \u2265 10 \u03bcM). Molecular features were extracted using Morgan and CDK fingerprints. Furthermore, we explored embedding feature computation using cutting-edge Large Language Models, including NVIDIA MegaMolBART, LLaMA 3.2, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Finally, we utilized the Logic Tensor Network (LTN), an advanced AI framework, to train and develop the hERG predictive model. Model performance was evaluated using two benchmarks: External Test-1 and hERG-70. The model outperformed several SOTA approaches, including CardioTox, M-PNN, DeepHIT, CardPred, OCHEM Predictor-II, Pred-hERG 4.2, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. On the External Test-1 dataset, hERG-LTN achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 0.931, a specificity (SPE) of 0.928, and a sensitivity (SEN) of 0.933. Furthermore, on the hERG-70 benchmark, our method achieved an accuracy of 0.827, a specificity of 0.890, and a correct classification rate (CCR) of 0.833. Overall, the Neuro-Symbolic AI approach sets a new standard for hERG-related cardiotoxicity assessment, yielding competitive results with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, and highlights its potential for advancing precision pharmacogenomics in drug discovery and development (GitHub: https://github.com/hossain013/hERG-LTN)."}

A handful of robots were experimented with, ending up with Dragonfly and GPT-4 being the only two eligible for in-depth investigation where the duo was individually requested to accord rating scores to the six major dimensions, namely (1) efficiency, (2) effectiveness, (3) learnability, (4) satisfaction, (5) accessibility, and (6) security, of the operating system versions. It is noteworthy that these dimensions are from the perceived user experience\u2019s point of view instead of any \u201cphysical\u201d technology\u2019s standpoint. For each of the two robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the six dimensions were computed across all the versions. The rating score difference for each of the six dimensions between the two robots was calculated for each version. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimension between the two robots were calculated across all versions. A paired sample t-test was then applied to each dimension for the rating score differences between the two robots over all the versions. Finally, a correlation coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each dimension between the two robots across all the versions. These computational outcomes were to confirm whether the two robots awarded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the versions, whether any of the two robots systematically underrated or overrated any dimension vis-\u00e0-vis the other robot, and whether there was consistency between the two robots in evaluating each dimension across the versions. It was found that discrimination was apparent in the evaluation of all dimensions, GPT-4 systematically underrated the dimensions satisfaction (p = 0.002 < 0.05) and security (p = 0.008 < 0.05) compared with Dragonfly, and the evaluation by the two robots was almost impeccably consistent for the six dimensions with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0.679 to 0.892 (p from 0.000 to 0.003 < 0.05). Consistency implies at least the partial trustworthiness of the evaluation of these mobile device operating system versions by either of these two popular generative AI robots based on the analogous concept of convergent validity."}

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for risk mitigation, cash flow optimization, and sustainable growth, existing research disproportionately focuses on large enterprises, leaving SME-specific barriers and opportunities underexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how AI adoption reshapes SME financial practices, with a dual focus on technological empowerment and systemic inequities. Employing a mixed-methods design, the research synthesizes findings from a systematic literature review (2020\u20132024) and primary data collected via surveys (n=300 SMEs) and interviews (n=30 managers) across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Quantitative analysis using structural equation modelling (SEM) and qualitative thematic analysis reveals that AI tools like ChatGPT and feedforward neural networks enhance risk assessment accuracy by 30\u201340% and reduce fraud detection time by 90%, while blockchain-AI integrations improve transactional transparency. However, data scarcity (reported by 68% of SMEs), infrastructure costs (57%), and skill gaps (63%) disproportionately hinder adoption, particularly in emerging markets. Theoretically, the study extends the Technology\u2013Organization\u2013Environment (TOE) model by emphasizing dynamic organizational learning and ethical governance as critical drivers of AI integration. Practically, it advocates for phased AI implementation strategies, starting with low-cost tools (e.g., generative AI for forecasting) and progressing to advanced systems, complemented by stakeholder training and policy interventions to subsidize infrastructure. The findings underscore AI\u2019s dual role as an enabler of financial resilience and a catalyst for structural inequities, urging policymakers to establish regulatory sandboxes and ethical frameworks to democratize access. This research bridges theoretical gaps in SME-centric AI adoption literature while offering actionable pathways for SMEs to harness AI\u2019s potential, fostering equitable and sustainable growth in the digital economy."}

Our findings underscore the imperative for individuals to exercise caution in safeguarding their personal information online, as user data can be collected, aggregated, and clustered with ease using modern Generative AI LLMs, RAG and ML techniques. Moreover, our study highlights the risks associated with metadata from camera photos uploaded to social networks. This metadata often includes timestamps, geolocation coordinates, and device information, which can be exploited to track activities, movements, and locations of individuals, effectively turning smartphones into IoT devices that provide continuous data streams. This aspect adds a critical layer to the discussion on cybersecurity, as it exposes how seemingly harmless data can be leveraged for surveillance and profiling. Additionally, we urge social platforms to carefully evaluate the types of user data accessible to third parties to mitigate potential security risks."}

This paper presents a novel framework for interpreting LLMs as probabilistic left context-sensitive languages (CSLs) generators. We hypothesize that Transformers can be effectively decomposed into three fundamental components: context windows, attention mechanisms, and autoregressive generation frameworks. This decomposition allows for the development of more flexible and interpretable computational models, moving beyond the traditional view of attention and autoregression as inseparable processes. We argue that next-token predictions can be understood as probabilistic, dynamic approximations of left CSL production rules, providing an intuitive explanation for how simple token predictions can yield human-like intelligence outputs. Given that all CSLs are left context-sensitive (Penttonen, 1974), we conclude that Transformers stochastically approximate CSLs, which are widely recognized as models of human-like intelligence. This interpretation bridges the gap between Formal Language Theory and the observed generative power of Transformers, laying a foundation for future advancements in generative AI theory and applications. Our novel perspective on Transformer architectures will foster a deeper understanding of LLMs and their future potentials."}

This paper introduces SCEditor-Web, a web-based modeling environment that combines model-driven engineering (MDE) with generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) to simplify contract design and code generation. Developers specify the structural and behavioral aspects of smart contracts through a domain-specific visual language grounded in a formal metamodel. The resulting contract model is exported as structured JSON and transformed into executable, platform-specific code using large language models (LLMs) guided by a tailored prompt engineering process. A prototype implementation was evaluated on Solidity contracts as a proof of concept, using representative use cases. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs assessed the generated contracts for compilability, semantic alignment with the contract model, and overall code quality. Results indicate that the visual-to-code workflow reduces manual effort, mitigates common programming errors, and supports developers with varying levels of expertise. The contributions include an abstract smart contract metamodel, a structured prompt generation pipeline, and a web-based platform that bridges high-level modeling with practical multi-language code synthesis. Together, these elements advance the integration of MDE and LLMs, demonstrating a step toward more accessible and reliable smart contract engineering."}

While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of AI design in the fashion industry, it also suggests that such approaches may not fully align with the distinct values of the luxury segment. Building on prior research, this paper investigates how AI can be more effectively integrated into luxury design. We propose that human\u2010AI co\u2010creation presents a promising approach, as it balances efficiency with the value people place on human effort. Across four empirical studies, we find that human\u2010AI co\u2010creation in luxury design generates more positive consumer responses than AI\u2010only designs. This effect is mediated by perceived design effort. Human\u2010AI co\u2010creation is viewed as involving greater design effort than AI\u2010only design, and human\u2010led co\u2010creation is perceived as requiring more effort than AI\u2010led co\u2010creation. We further examine the moderating roles of co\u2010creation modes and luxury product types, revealing that human\u2010led (vs. AI\u2010led) co\u2010creation enhances perceived design effort and, in turn, improves brand attitudes, particularly for hedonic (vs. functional) luxury products. These findings offer valuable insights for luxury brands navigating the era of intelligent design, highlighting the importance of balancing human creativity with AI capabilities to sustain brand value and foster consumer acceptance."}

Businesses globally are eager to leverage this transformative technology; however, they encounter several challenges in utilizing the technology, including initial and running costs, data protection, infrastructure, adaptability across use-cases, accuracy, ethical implications, and the burgeoning carbon impact of GenAI, which act as barriers to entry. A low-cost, low-carbon impact GenAI platform that exclusively uses open-source components and smaller task-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) is necessary.This paper presents a GenAI platform that employs open-source components and models orchestrated for multiple cross-industry use-cases. The platform is designed to be cloud-provider agnostic, highly secure, scalable, and requires low infrastructure to deploy, thereby using comparatively less energy and having a lower carbon impact. These features enable several advantages, including domain transference, localization in different languages using prompt tuning, and easy deployment of complex multimodal, cross-industry, cross-domain use-cases. We have tested our platform on numerous use-cases across several key patterns, including text-to-text, text-to-code, text-to-analytics and text-to-image. All these configurations provide a semantic interface to unstructured text, tabular data, images, videos, and speech. The platform, the methodology, and ideas presented in this paper will provide enterprises with a blueprint of how to orchestrate GenAI using open-source components.Our experience building a multi-modal open GenAI platform and our investigation and analyses of primary patterns in enterprise use-cases for GenAI suggest that the proposed low-cost, low-carbon, model-to-the-data platform has the potential to revolutionize the adoption of GenAI technologies within business enterprises.

The emergence of generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), offers new possibilities for social network generation: LLMs can generate networks without additional training or need to define network parameters, and users can flexibly define individuals in the network using natural language. However, this potential raises two critical questions: 1) are the social networks generated by LLMs realistic, and 2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to a suite of real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with \u201clocal\u201d methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to \u201cglobal\u201d methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, connectivity, and degree distribution. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and significantly overestimate political homophily compared to real social networks."}

The interacting behaviors, such as sharing artworks with descriptions, commenting on creations, and creators' subsequent replying are the essential components of user engagement in these communities. Understanding the influence of AIGC on the evolving user engagement could be helpful for community regulation. In this work, we collect 235K posts and their associated 255K comments from DeviantArt, a large creative community allowing uploading AIGC. Through open coding, we identify five categories of practices in describing and commenting on artworks, respectively. A set of deep learning models are applied to classify the posts and comments. We then combine time series regression analysis, causal inference analysis, and logistic regression analysis, to examine the impact of the surge of AIGC on user engagement. Results suggest that AI-generated artworks show a decreasing emphasis on the content of creations but an increasing trend toward commercial and promotion purposes. AI-generated artworks emphasize less on IP issues than human-created ones, while the awareness of IP issues drops for human-created artworks with the growth of AIGC as well. Although comments with high sentiment valence, for peer bonding or for requesting usage positively predict the reply behavior for human-created artworks, community members are less likely to maintain these interactions as AIGC rises. Finally, we discuss insights and design implications for OCCs."}

Using a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, the study engaged 35 second-year English majors in an eight-week intervention. Data collection included pre- and post-tests, five AI-integrated reading tasks, a structured questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative results revealed significant improvements in students\u2019 ability to recognize bias, generate counterarguments, and identify main ideas. Qualitative analysis of ChatGPT interaction screenshots and student reflections demonstrated behavioral progression from surface-level clarification-seeking to more critical inquiry and evaluative questioning. Students reported high motivation and appreciation for AI's role in supporting comprehension and analysis. However, they also expressed skepticism, frequently verifying AI outputs and reflecting on potential bias. These behaviors contrast with earlier studies that emphasized uncritical reliance on AI tools, highlighting the emergence of critical digital literacy in this context. The findings suggest that AI can serve not only as a comprehension aid but also as a scaffold for cognitive and ethical engagement. When paired with explicit instruction, AI tools hold promises for fostering critical literacy and responsible use of technology in EFL education."}

This article therefore offers child-centred AI design and policy recommendations to help make large language models (LLMs) utilised in conversational and generative AI systems safer for children. Conceptualising the risk of LLMs as \u2018an empathy gap\u2019, this research-based conceptual article focuses on the need to design LLMs that prevent or mitigate against the risks of responding inappropriately to children's personal disclosures or accidentally promoting harm. The article synthesises selected cases of human chatbot interaction and research findings across education, computer science and human-computer interaction studies. It concludes with practical recommendations for child-safe AI across eight dimensions of design and policy: content and communication; human intervention; transparency; accountability; justifiability; regulation; school-family engagement; and child-centred design methodologies. These eight dimensions are tailored to a variety of stakeholders, from policymakers and AI developers to educators and caregivers."}

While the societal impact of foundation models is growing, transparency is on the decline, mirroring the opacity that has plagued past digital technologies (e.g. social media). Reversing this trend is essential: transparency is a vital precondition for public accountability, scientific innovation, and effective governance. To assess the transparency of the foundation model ecosystem and help improve transparency over time, we introduce the Foundation Model Transparency Index. The Foundation Model Transparency Index specifies 100 fine-grained indicators that comprehensively codify transparency for foundation models, spanning the upstream resources used to build a foundation model (e.g data, labor, compute), details about the model itself (e.g. size, capabilities, risks), and the downstream use (e.g. distribution channels, usage policies, affected geographies). We score 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google, Meta) against the 100 indicators to assess their transparency. To facilitate and standardize assessment, we score developers in relation to their practices for their flagship foundation model (e.g. GPT-4 for OpenAI, PaLM 2 for Google, Llama 2 for Meta). We present 10 top-level findings about the foundation model ecosystem: for example, no developer currently discloses significant information about the downstream impact of its flagship model, such as the number of users, affected market sectors, or how users can seek redress for harm. Overall, the Foundation Model Transparency Index establishes the level of transparency today to drive progress on foundation model governance via industry standards and regulatory intervention."}

This paper explores the application of quantum computing to telecom KPI optimization, contrasting its capabilities with those of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Telecom networks face increasing complexity due to rising data demands, 5 G deployment, and user expectations, necessitating advanced optimization techniques beyond traditional methods. While generative AI has shown promise in modeling network behaviour and predicting KPIs, it struggles with scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale, real-time systems. Quantum computing, leveraging principles like superposition and entanglement, excels in solving combinatorial optimization problems inherent in telecom networks, such as resource allocation and latency reduction. Through a detailed comparison, this paper highlights quantum computing\u2019s superior speed, precision, and ability to handle multi-dimensional KPI datasets. A conceptual quantum framework for telecom optimization is proposed, supported by theoretical examples. The study concludes that while generative AI offers flexibility, quantum computing provides transformative advantages for future telecom systems, paving the way for nextgeneration network efficiency. Challenges such as hardware limitations and algorithm development are also discussed, alongside future research directions."}

The RAG framework seamlessly combines the capabilities of large-scale language models with retriever models, facilitating the generation of diverse and contextually relevant recommendations tailored to individual preferences and interests, all of which are based on natural language queries. These systems iteratively learn and adapt to user feedback, thereby continuously refining and improving recommendation quality over time. This dynamic learning process enables the system to dynamically adjust to changes in user preferences, emerging travel trends, and contextual factors, ensuring that the recommendations remain pertinent and personalized. Furthermore, we explore the incorporation of personality models like the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Big Five (BF) personality traits into personalized travel recommendation systems. By incorporating these personality models, our research aims to enrich the understanding of user preferences and behavior, allowing for even more precise and tailored recommendations. We explore the potential synergies between personality psychology and advanced AI techniques, specifically the RAG framework with a personality model, in revolutionizing personalized travel recommendations. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth examination of the underlying principles, methodologies, and technical intricacies of these advanced AI techniques, emphasizing their ability to understand natural language queries, retrieve relevant information from vast knowledge bases, and generate contextually rich recommendations tailored to individual personalities. In our personalized travel recommendation system model, results are achieved such as user satisfaction (78%), system accuracy (82%), and the performance rate based on user personality traits (85% for extraversion and 75% for introversion)."}

While observability and alerting systems have matured considerably, incident response still relies heavily on human expertise, thus introducing a significant gap between detection and automated remediation that translates into very costly downtime and operational fatigue. This article introduces a closed-loop remediation framework powered by Generative AI, enabling the diagnosis, execution, and validation of incident resolution with appropriate safety guardrails and auditability. Within this framework, the model integrates LLM-based diagnostics, policy-driven execution, and safety validation mechanisms, with continuous learning feedback cycles. The article draws best practices from multi-cloud implementation and puts forward a phased implementation approach while discussing governance considerations toward autonomous remediation. This framework demonstrates substantial improvement in incident resolution speed and reduction in manual escalations, thus positioning autonomous incident remediation as the cornerstone for the next evolution in AI-powered reliability engineering. As systems continue to scale beyond human cognitive limits, such autonomous approaches are not just advantageous but also become very key for operational resilience amidst ever-increasing digital environment complexities."}

Indeed, it may provide personalized, interactive and empowering pedagogical sequences that could favor students' intrinsic motivation, active engagement and help them have more control over their learning. But at the same time, other GAI properties such as the lack of uncertainty signalling even in cases of failure (particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs)) could lead to opposite effects, e.g. over-estimation of one's own competencies, passiveness, loss of curious and critical-thinking sense, etc. These negative effects are due in particular to the lack of a pedagogical stance in these models' behaviors. Indeed, as opposed to standard pedagogical activities, GAI systems are often designed to answers users' inquiries easily and conveniently, without asking them to make an effort, and without focusing on their learning process and/or outcomes. This article starts by outlining some of these opportunities and challenges surrounding the use of GAI in education, with a focus on the effects on students' active learning strategies and related metacognitive skills. Then, we present a framework for introducing pedagogical transparency in GAI-based educational applications. This framework presents 1) training methods to include pedagogical principles in the models, 2) methods to ensure controlled and pedagogically-relevant interactions when designing activities with GAI and 3) educational methods enabling students to acquire the relevant skills to properly benefit from the use of GAI in their learning activities (meta-cognitive skills, GAI litteracy)."}

We can further break down the problem into (1) data sparsity from the angle of data representation and (2) data scarcity from the angle of data quantity. In this thesis, I will discuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2) rehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity, respectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but tactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical world, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of contact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only exploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning to make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand, rehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the significant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at scale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical school and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand orthosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and uses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the orthosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment.

Based on Bloom\u2019s taxonomy (remember & understand / apply & analyze / evaluate & create), three essay-items and rubrics were developed, and ten types of prompts were designed. Automated scoring results based on GPT model were quantitatively and qualitatively compared to teacher scoring results. The key findings are as follows. First, the effectiveness of prompt types varied depending on the cognitive level required by the item. In particular, for lower-order items, prompts such as \u201cChain of Thought\u201d and \u201cMulti-Zero-Shot\u201d that encouraged step-by-step reasoning showed higher accuracy. Second, scoring performance improved when rubrics and Zero-Shot prompts were written clearly and specifically. Third, prompts with added sample answers or few-shot prompts performed worse than Zero-Shot prompts, despite the additional input cost. Finally, when tested on new data, the optimal prompts demonstrated \u2019almost perfect\u2018 agreement with teacher scoring (QWK=0.88, 0.86 for Items 1 and 2) and \u2019substantial\u2019 agreement (QWK=0.63 for Item 3). In addition, qualitative analyses of disagreement cases were conducted, and the usefulness of each prompt technique was discussed in detail."}

Findings showed that ChatGPT 3.5's replies frequently reflected cultural relativism, as evidenced by an emphasis in the outputs on the idea that different cultures hold distinct perspectives and that these diverse viewpoints should be respected. In contrast, Bard's responses often stressed human rights and provided more support for gay people and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer (LGBTQ)+\u2009issues. Both systems demonstrated significant variation in their responses depending on the contextual information provided in the prompts, suggesting that AI systems may adjust the degree and form of support they express for LGBTQ+\u2009people and issues according to the information they receive about a user's background. While our analysis focused specifically on chatbot responses to homophobic statements, the study underscores a broader dilemma concerning the tension between cultural relativism and universal human rights in generative AI\u2014an issue that extends beyond homophobia to include animosity toward other marginalized groups that are perceived differently across societies and religions.

Research has shown that GAI technology has significantly contributed to several domains like healthcare, cybersecurity, industry 4.0, gaming, etc. GAI technology is also vital in vehicular networks and intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a diffusion model-based data augmentation for enhanced vehicular network applications. The existing data augmentation techniques fail to modify the semantics of the images in the dataset. Addressing this, we propose a diffusion-based model for effective data augmentation. The augmentation technique involves feeding a randomly generated prompt (covering several image features like weather, lighting, background, visibility, and surface) along with canny edge features of an existing image to a diffusion model to generate an image with desired features. We used a vision-based accident detection dataset and a MobileNet-based deep learning model to understand the efficacy of the proposed data augmentation technique. Our experimental analysis indicates the proposed data augmentation technique improves the performance notably (3%)."}

Initially, it was posited that artificial intelligence (AI) would excel beyond human abilities in computational tasks and algorithmic operations, leaving creativity and humanities as uniquely human domains. However, recent advancements in large language models have significantly challenged these conventional beliefs about AI\u2019s limitations and strengths. It is projected that, in the near future, generative AI models will adeptly replicate individual qualities, desires, beliefs, opinions, and the essence of human identity and consciousness to a degree that is nearly indistinguishable from that of humans. This lends support to the connectionist approach to understanding consciousness, suggesting an inherent similarity between biological and artificial neural networks. The discussion posits two innovative areas of scientific inquiry: \u201cmathematical anthropology\u201d and \u201cmulti-dimensional calculus of value.\u201d The former suggests that viewing human nature through a mathematical and calculative lens not only preserves but enriches our understanding of the complexity of anthropological experience and its perceived contradictions. The latter hypothesis explores how mathematical models could facilitate various social interactions. The advanced simulation capabilities of neural networks suggest that traditional social and political frameworks face a growing vulnerability to AI-driven manipulations. This trend underscores the urgency of developing social interaction models that incorporate explicitly defined calculative rules. In conclusion, the paper advocates for a paradigm shift in how mathematics is perceived \u2013 not merely as a tool for computation but as a foundational science for crafting sophisticated models. In conclusion, the article advocates for transitioning from perceiving mathematics solely as a science of computation to viewing it as a discipline dedicated to constructing various formalized models, thereby deepening our insight into the complexities of human and social phenomena."}

(2024) to develop the Generative AI Susceptibility Index (GAISI), a task-based measure of UK job exposure to large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. GAISI is derived from probabilistic task ratings by LLMs and linked to worker-reported task data from the Skills and Employment Surveys. It reflects the share of job activities where an LLM or LLM-powered system can reduce task completion time by at least 25% beyond existing productivity tools. The index demonstrates high reliability, strong alignment with AI capabilities, and superior predictive power compared to existing exposure measures. By 2023-24, nearly all UK jobs exhibited some exposure, yet only a minority were heavily affected. Aggregate exposure has risen since 2017, primarily due to occupational shifts rather than changes in task profiles. The price premium for AI-exposed tasks declined relative to 2017, measuring approximately 12% lower in 2023-24. Job postings fell following the release of ChatGPT, with job postings 5.5% lower in 2025-Q2 than if pre-GPT hiring patterns had persisted. GAISI offers a robust framework for assessing AI's impact on work, providing early evidence that displacement effects may already outweigh productivity gains."}

Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models, the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM), which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space. We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of image restoration and generation."}

While these tools offer unprecedented access to information and companionship, a growing body of evidence suggests they may also induce or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms, particularly in vulnerable individuals. This paper conducts a narrative literature review of peer-reviewed studies, credible media reports, and case analyses to explore emerging mental health concerns associated with AI-human interactions. Three major themes are identified: psychological dependency and attachment formation, crisis incidents and harmful outcomes, and heightened vulnerability among specific populations including adolescents, elderly adults, and individuals with mental illness. Notably, the paper discusses high-profile cases, including the suicide of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III, which highlight the severe consequences of unregulated AI relationships. Findings indicate that users often anthropomorphize AI systems, forming parasocial attachments that can lead to delusional thinking, emotional dysregulation, and social withdrawal. Additionally, preliminary neuroscientific data suggest cognitive impairment and addictive behaviors linked to prolonged AI use. Despite the limitations of available data, primarily anecdotal and early-stage research, the evidence points to a growing public health concern. The paper emphasizes the urgent need for validated diagnostic criteria, clinician training, ethical oversight, and regulatory protections to address the risks posed by increasingly human-like AI systems. Without proactive intervention, society may face a mental health crisis driven by widespread, emotionally charged human-AI relationships."}

A quasi-experimental design was employed, comparing traditional instruction with an AI-augmented pedagogy that delegated lower-order writing tasks to generative AI tools, allowing students to focus on analysis, evaluation, and reflection. Over 12 weeks, 240 participants engaged in structured writing cycles involving AI brainstorming, individual critique, peer-AI co-revision, and reflective journaling. Results revealed that the AI-enabled cognitive offload group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in standardized critical thinking assessments and produced higher-quality essays in terms of logical coherence, evidence use, and originality. Mediation analysis indicated that cognitive offloading behavior partially explained the relationship between AI use and critical thinking gains. The findings suggest that when generative AI is integrated into pedagogy through deliberate scaffolding, it can enhance rather than hinder higher-order thinking. This study highlights the importance of balancing technological efficiency with instructional strategies that promote active engagement, metacognitive reflection, and collaborative learning. It offers practical implications for educators seeking to incorporate AI tools without compromising the development of essential cognitive skills, proposing that structured cognitive offload instruction can serve as an effective approach to fostering critical thinking in second-language writing contexts."}

This Perspectives article calls for applying a planetary health lens to the digital determinants of health, with a focus on the impacts of novel generative AI technologies on the natural world. The argument is founded on the principle that human and planetary health are intertwined and that digital technologies such as generative AI affect the health of both humans and the other living things in ecosystems. The article discusses proposals of how generative AI tools can contribute to action on the climate, loss of biodiversity and pollution crises but also highlights how the expansion of generative AI infrastructure and operation has exacerbated the problems of e-waste, greenhouse gas emissions and major burdens on energy and water resources. It is argued that for progress to be made in improving human and planetary health, those working in health promotion and other public health domains must acknowledge that human and planetary health are interdependent, so that we can refer to the \u2018digital determinants of human and planetary health\u2019. The article highlights this interdependence and the importance of fighting for multispecies justice and the rights of nature to promote the mutual flourishing of humans and the natural world. Actions are proposed that can be taken at the organization and community level to make visible and counter the impacts of generative AI on human and planetary health."}

We describe ChatNetZero\u2019s design, particularly the innovation of anti-hallucination and reference modules designed to enhance the accuracy and credibility of generated responses. To evaluate ChatNetZero\u2019s performance against other LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini, Coral, and ChatClimate, we conduct two types of validation: comparing LLMs\u2019 generated responses to original source documents to verify their factual accuracy, and employing an expert survey to evaluate the overall quality, accuracy and relevance of each response. We find that while ChatNetZero responses show higher factual accuracy when compared to original source data, experts surveyed prefer lengthier responses that provide more context. Our results highlight the importance of prioritizing information presentation in the design of domain-specific LLMs to ensure that scientific information is effectively communicated, especially as even expert audiences find it challenging to assess the credibility of AI-generated content."}

Objectives This systematic review aims to evaluate the current capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models in the context of mental health applications. Methods A comprehensive search across 5 databases yielded 1046 references, of which 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were original research with experimental designs (eg, Turing tests, sociocognitive tasks, trials, or qualitative methods); a focus on GenAI models; and explicit measurement of sociocognitive abilities (eg, empathy and emotional awareness), mental health outcomes, and user experience (eg, perceived trust and empathy). Results The studies, published between 2023 and 2024, primarily evaluated models such as ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0, Bard, and Claude in tasks such as psychoeducation, diagnosis, emotional awareness, and clinical interventions. Most studies used zero-shot prompting and human evaluators to assess the AI responses, using standardized rating scales or qualitative analysis. However, these methods were often insufficient to fully capture the complexity of GenAI capabilities. The reliance on single-shot prompting techniques, limited comparisons, and task-based assessments isolated from a context may oversimplify GenAI\u2019s abilities and overlook the nuances of human\u2013artificial intelligence interaction, especially in clinical applications that require contextual reasoning and cultural sensitivity. The findings suggest that while GenAI models demonstrate strengths in psychoeducation and emotional awareness, their diagnostic accuracy, cultural competence, and ability to engage users emotionally remain limited. Users frequently reported concerns about trustworthiness, accuracy, and the lack of emotional engagement. Conclusions Future research could use more sophisticated evaluation methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting to fully uncover GenAI\u2019s potential. Longitudinal studies and broader comparisons with human benchmarks are needed to explore the effects of GenAI-integrated mental health care."}

The draft Measures related to the regulation of generative AI. However, in terms of technical features(\u2460data; \u2461algorithm; \u2462AIGC; \u2463forming public opinion), there are current laws and regulations(\u2460Cybersecurity Law\u00b7Data Security Law\u00b7PIPL; \u2461Algorithm Regulation; \u2462Deepfake Regulation; \u2463Public Opinion Regulation). As abovementioned, China had a way to regulate generative. Nevertheless, the reason for rushing to enact the Measures is that generative AI has caused great social repercussions. China stipulates the protection of IP rights and personal information, and the prevention of monopoly of Big Tech to fill the legislative gap. A careful examination of the Measures reveals that the main purpose of enacting the Measures is not to resolve conflicts of rights. It focuses on strengthening national security in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Because, in the process of data processing using AI technology, information related to national security may be exposed, and users can make behaviors that threaten social order by distributing AIGC. In addition, China\u2019s expert groups take it as a serious problem that the gap in AI skills between the US and China will fundamentally affect the national competitiveness of the two countries. In order for Chinese Big Tech to narrow the technological gap amid adverse circumstances the legislation and policies will have to be supported. From this point of view, it is difficult to see that the Measures is intended to add new regulations on generative AI. Rather, it can be seen as an attempt to strengthen the technological capabilities of Chinese Big Tech while maintaining the current level of regulation on generative AI. In addition, it implies the intention to use the Measures when a situation that threatens national security triggered by generative AI."}

The article explores and systematizes possible areas of application of AI in video game development and gameplay. In general, eight areas of possible implementation of AI in GameDev are described, namely: creating a graphical interface; creating 3D objects in video games; writing dialogues and text content in video games; creating music; voicing characters; creating animation; writing and testing program code; testing video games. Various areas of possible application of AI in video game development were experimentally tested and confirmed during the development by the authors of a game in the adventure genre with horror elements. The authors detailed the applied aspects of using various modern AI tools using the example of developing the corresponding components of the 3D game environment of the game \"Labyrinth of Darkness\". The use of AI helps to optimize labor-intensive processes, such as content creation and testing, which helps to speed up production cycles and improve the quality of the final product. To achieve the desired gaming style, AI tools allow you to generate several variants of images of game environment elements in order to select the most suitable ones for further adaptation into the game's graphical interface. To do this, deep learning algorithms analyze thousands of texture samples, creating new variations that look natural and meet modern graphics requirements. Thus, the active integration of AI technology into the modern video game development process significantly changes the approaches to testing and improving game products. On the other hand, the paper considers the difficulties and disadvantages of using AI in game development and testing. Currently, generative AI in game development and testing requires careful monitoring, adaptation, and testing. The best solution is to combine the capabilities of AI and the creative approach of developers, which guarantees high-quality content and a unique gaming experience."}

Amid growing global interest in educational technologies, particularly the Metaverse and GenAI, this study addresses the under-explored integration of these tools in primary EFL education (Lo, 2023). While tertiary contexts have seen notable innovations, primary education lacks empirical insights into how immersive and interactive technologies can foster authentic, communicative, and student-centred learning experiences (Tlili et al., 2022; Tlili et al., 2023). \n\u00a0 \nThe integration of Metaverse and GenAI offers the potential to create immersive, authentic and socially rich EFL learning environments. In contexts where young learners often lack authentic opportunities for language use, Metaverse platforms\u2014such as Minecraft Education\u2014can simulate real-life scenarios for practising everyday communication, such as giving directions or role-playing interactions in cafes or shops (Dalgarno & Lee, 2010). These tasks promote experiential, meaningful language use, moving beyond rote memorisation (Breen, 1985; Inceoglu & Ciloglugil, 2022). Meanwhile, LLMs like ChatGPT function as accessible, responsive language partners (Kasneci et al., 2023). They offer real-time feedback, personalised prompts, and scaffolded support tailored to individual learner needs (Sharples, 2023). \n\u00a0 \nThis presentation proposes a practical methodology to enhance EFL learning in primary schools through a hybrid learning environment (HLE) that integrates Metaverse and LLM. To systematically design and evaluate this environment, the study adopts a Design-Based Research (DBR) approach. This iterative methodology enables the development, implementation, and refinement of authentic learning solutions in collaboration with practitioners. The research unfolds across four phases (Reeves, 2006): \n\u00a0 \n \nPhase 1: Problem Analysis and Literature Review \n \nIdentify challenges in current EFL practices through literature review and teacher collaboration. \nEstablish theoretical foundation and research questions. \n \nPhase 2: Developing Draft Design Principles and Potential Learning Solutions \n \nDevelop draft design principles grounded in authentic learning (Herrington et al., 2010; Herrington & Oliver, 2000), community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger et al., 2005), and the Conversational Framework (Laurillard, 2012). \nCo-design learning tasks using Metaverse and LLM aligned with curriculum objectives. \nPrepare a prototype HLE for implementation. \n \nPhase 3: Implementation, Data Collection and Analysis \n \nImplement the learning solution in a primary school in Korea. \nEvaluate learning outcomes by observations, interviews, teacher reflections, and surveys. \nConduct iterative cycles of refinement based on feedback and data analysis. \n \nPhase 4: Research Outputs and Reflections \n \nSynthesise findings to refine the pedagogical framework and design principles. \nDevelop open-access resources, teacher guides, and recommendations for scalable adoption. \nShare results through academic publications, workshops, and practitioner networks. \n \n \n\u00a0 \nThis presentation will provide an overview of the four phases of the DBR process, while highlighting the five draft design principles developed in Phase 2 and the example learning solutions that emerged from them. These principles and tasks illustrate how Metaverse and LLMs can be integrated to create authentic and conversational EFL learning experiences in the primary education context. \n\u00a0 \nReferences \n\u00a0 \nBreen, M.

Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline."}

Patients frequently rely on online resources and mobile apps for diabetes-related information; however, these often lead to information overload, limited personalization, and difficulty in navigation. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots may address these challenges by providing accessible, personalized, and responsive guidance. Objective This study aimed to explore the potential role of generative AI chatbots in diabetes management through a 2-part qualitative evaluation. Part 1 examined patients\u2019 information needs, user experiences, and expectations. Part 2 investigated specialists\u2019 perspectives on the practical utility of generative AI chatbots in supporting diabetes self-management. By incorporating perspectives from both patients and specialists, the study aimed to identify appropriate boundaries for the involvement of generative AI chatbots, reflecting the needs and expectations of both stakeholder groups. Methods This study was conducted using DTalksBot, a generative AI chatbot powered by GPT-4 (OpenAI) and enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation. In Part 1, we aimed to understand the experiences, needs, and expectations of patients with diabetes. To achieve this, 24 participants engaged in structured chatbot sessions, completed postinteraction surveys, and participated in in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed using thematic and content analysis to identify patterns in user queries and experiences. In part 2, we invited 4 family medicine specialists to assess the accuracy of DTalksBot\u2019s responses by reviewing conversation logs and to share expert insights on the future role of generative AI chatbots in diabetes management. Results In part 1, a total of 24 patients submitted a total of 643 questions, which were categorized into 4 primary themes: personalized health advice and guidance (n=281, 44.6%), complications and comorbidities (n=174, 27.1%), medication and treatment exploration (n=111, 17.3%), and mental health management and support (n=30, 4.7%). Patients emphasized the advantages of generative AI chatbots over traditional information sources, including faster access to reliable content, reduced cognitive burden, and the ability to comfortably discuss sensitive topics. In part 2, specialists recognized the generative AI chatbots\u2019 value in answering routine inquiries, but noted limitations in contextual accuracy, real-time data integration, and response personalization. Conclusions Generative AI chatbots showed promise as complementary tools for diabetes self-management by offering accessible, reliable, and tailored support. This formative evaluation provides empirical evidence on how generative AI chatbots can address patient information needs and complement existing health care resources. To maximize utility, future generative AI chatbots need to integrate real-time health data, enhance contextual relevance, and align with clinical workflows to ensure safety, trust, and broader applicability."}

In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts."}

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs. Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation."}

Numerous nations have adopted Generative AI (GenAI), a disruptive technology that compels electoral bodies to advocate for the integration of such tools into governance, electoral, and democratic processes. Nevertheless, these technologies do not ensure effortless integration or efficient usage owing to intricate socio-cultural and human dynamics. Certain African jurisdictions are ill-prepared for the adoption of these technologies due to factors including underdevelopment, insufficient electrical supply, lack of technology literacy, reluctance to change, and the goals of governing parties. This study examines generative artificial intelligence as a disruptive technology for enhancing governance, political knowledge, electoral processes, and democracy. A mixed-method approach was employed, incorporating surveys and in-person interviews. The analysis of data, debates, and interpretation of findings were grounded in postdigital theory and theme analysis employing an abductive reasoning technique, in alignment with the tenets of critical realism. The study demonstrated that GENAI can influence political knowledge, election processes, and enhance efficiency in government and democracy. Moreover, GENAI, including ChatGPT, can either exacerbate or mitigate societal tendencies that contribute to human division, facilitate the dissemination of misinformation, perpetuate echo chambers, and undermine social and political trust, as well as polarise disparate groups or sets of viewpoints or beliefs. AI offers substantial opportunities but also poses many obstacles, including technical constraints, ethical dilemmas, and social ramifications. The swift progression of AI may disrupt labour markets by automating tasks conventionally executed by people, resulting in job displacement. Implementing AI necessitates significant upskilling and proficiency with digital tools; therefore, governments and organisations must adequately train their personnel to reconcile the disparity between AI's capabilities and users' comprehension. Additionally, there is a requisite for governmental oversight, regulation, and monitoring of AI adoption and utilisation across all facets of its implementation."}

Herein, we show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims' systems. To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks."}

The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality."}

The patient treatment life cycle generates a significant volume of data points that can offer valuable insights to improve patient care by guiding clinical decision-making. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, Generative AI (GAI), are promising tools in this regard, particularly after the introduction of Large Language Models. The European Federation of Internal Medicine (EFIM) recognizes the transformative impact of AI in leveraging clinical data and advancing the field of internal medicine. This position paper from the EFIM explores how AI can be applied to achieve the goals of P6 Medicine principles in internal medicine. P6 Medicine is an advanced healthcare model that extends the concept of Personalized Medicine toward a holistic, predictive, patient-centered approach that also integrates psycho-cognitive and socially responsible dimensions. An additional concept introduced is that of Digital Therapies (DTx), software applications designed to prevent and manage diseases and disorders through AI, which are used in the clinical setting if validated by rigorous research studies. Methods: The literature examining the relationship between AI and Internal Medicine was investigated through a bibliometric analysis. The themes identified in the literature review were further examined through the Delphi method. Thirty international AI and Internal Medicine experts constituted the Delphi panel. Results: Delphi results were summarized in a SWOT Analysis. The evidence is that through extensive data analysis, diagnostic capacity, drug development and patient tracking are increased. Conclusions: The panel unanimously considered AI in Internal Medicine as an opportunity, achieving a complete consensus on the matter. AI-driven solutions, including clinical applications of GAI and DTx, hold the potential to strongly change internal medicine by streamlining workflows, enhancing patient care and generating valuable data."}

Objective This study aims to comparatively evaluate the answers provided by 4 LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bing Chat (Microsoft Corp), to clinically relevant questions from the field of dentistry. Methods The LLMs were queried with 20 open-type, clinical dentistry\u2013related questions from different disciplines, developed by the respective faculty of the School of Dentistry, European University Cyprus. The LLMs\u2019 answers were graded 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) points against strong, traditionally collected scientific evidence, such as guidelines and consensus statements, using a rubric, as if they were examination questions posed to students, by 2 experienced faculty members. The scores were statistically compared to identify the best-performing model using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Moreover, the evaluators were asked to provide a qualitative evaluation of the comprehensiveness, scientific accuracy, clarity, and relevance of the LLMs\u2019 answers. Results Overall, no statistically significant difference was detected between the scores given by the 2 evaluators; therefore, an average score was computed for every LLM. Although ChatGPT-4 statistically outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 (P=.008), Bing Chat (P=.049), and Bard (P=.045), all models occasionally exhibited inaccuracies, generality, outdated content, and a lack of source references. The evaluators noted instances where the LLMs delivered irrelevant information, vague answers, or information that was not fully accurate. Conclusions This study demonstrates that although LLMs hold promising potential as an aid in the implementation of evidence-based dentistry, their current limitations can lead to potentially harmful health care decisions if not used judiciously. Therefore, these tools should not replace the dentist\u2019s critical thinking and in-depth understanding of the subject matter. Further research, clinical validation, and model improvements are necessary for these tools to be fully integrated into dental practice. Dental practitioners must be aware of the limitations of LLMs, as their imprudent use could potentially impact patient care. Regulatory measures should be established to oversee the use of these evolving technologies."}

Wi-Fi standards define features enabling the allocation of radio resources across time, frequency, and link band. However, radio resource slicing, as implemented in 5G cellular networks, is not native to Wi-Fi. A few reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed for Wi-Fi resource allocation and demonstrated using analytical models where the reward gradient with respect to the model parameters is accessible\u2014i.e., with a differentiable Wi-Fi network model. In this work, we implement\u2014and release under an Apache 2.0 license\u2014a state-of-the-art, state-augmented constrained optimization method using a policy-gradient RL algorithm that does not require a differentiable model, to assess model-free RL-based slicing for Wi-Fi frequency resource allocation. We compare this with six model-free baselines: three RL algorithms (REINFORCE, A2C, PPO), two rule-based heuristics (Uniform, Proportional), and a generative AI policy using a commercial foundational Large Language Model (LLM). For rapid RL training, a simple, non-differentiable network model was used. To evaluate the policies, we use an ns-3-based Wi-Fi 6 simulator with a slice-aware MAC. Evaluations were conducted in two traffic scenarios: A) a periodic pattern with one constant low-throughput slice and two high-throughput slices toggled sequentially, and B) a random walk scenario for realism. Results show that, on average\u2014in terms of the trade-off between total throughput and a packet-latency-based metric\u2014the uniform split and LLM-based policy perform best, appearing on the Pareto front in both scenarios. The proportional policy only appears on the front in the periodic case. Our state-augmented constrained approach based on REINFORCE (SAC-RE) is on the second Pareto front for the random walk case, outperforming vanilla REINFORCE. In the periodic scenario, vanilla REINFORCE achieves better throughput\u2014with a latency trade-off\u2014and is co-located with SAC-RE on the second front. Interestingly, the LLM-based policy\u2014neither trained nor fine-tuned on any custom data\u2014consistently appears on the first Pareto front, offering higher objective values at some latency cost. Unlike uniform slicing, its behavior is dynamically adjustable via prompt engineering."}

Healthcare institutions are discussing or have started utilizing these innovative technologies within their workflow. Major electronic health record vendors have begun to leverage large language models to process and analyze vast amounts of clinical natural language text, performing a wide range of tasks in healthcare settings to help alleviate clinicians' burden. Although such technologies can be helpful in applications such as patient education, drafting responses to patient questions and emails, medical record summarization, and medical research facilitation, there are concerns about the tools' readiness for use within the healthcare domain and acceptance by the current workforce. The goal of this article is to provide nurses with an understanding of the currently available foundation models and artificial intelligence tools, enabling them to evaluate the need for such tools and assess how they can impact current clinical practice. This will help nurses efficiently assess, implement, and evaluate these tools to ensure these technologies are ethically and effectively integrated into healthcare systems, while also rigorously monitoring their performance and impact on patient care."}

The objective of this study is to examine whether generative AI can provide a structured and dependable pathway for modernising complex .NET applications while reducing the extensive manual effort traditionally required for refactoring and architectural redesign. The research problem centres on assessing the ability of generative AI to interpret the semantics of legacy code, propose optimised transformations, and preserve functional accuracy throughout the modernisation process. A mixed-methods approach was used, incorporating quantitative evaluation of code quality gains, transformation precision, and performance improvements, alongside qualitative analysis of developer experience, maintainability, and architectural alignment. Key findings show that generative AI accelerates modernisation workflows, enhances consistency across transformed modules, and supports the transition of legacy logic to modular, cloud-oriented, and testable designs. The study contributes strategically by presenting a structured framework for integrating AI-assisted refactoring into enterprise modernisation initiatives and academically by offering a comprehensive assessment of generative AI capabilities in legacy system evolution. The results indicate that generative AI can act as a powerful catalyst when combined with human oversight, validation, and governance."}

According to a survey in Japan, approximately 64.5% of workers cited \u201cearning income\u201d as their primary reason for working, while only about 20% cited \u201cto utilize my abilities\u201d or \u201cto find purpose.\u201d However, in the author\u2019s career counseling practice, many clients express a desire for meaningful work and fulfillment. This suggests that while they may not currently experience intrinsic value in their work, they fundamentally seek meaning in employment. Against this backdrop, this study aims to establish a career design methodology that redefines the meaning of work.This study employed a qualitative approach. First, an integrated framework was constructed, leading to a hypothesis for a career design process focused on meaningful work. Drawing on Mark L. Savickas\u2019s narrative career counseling and Roberto Verganti\u2019s innovation of meaning, a hypothetical career design process was proposed to reveal both the inner sense of meaning in work and the creation of new societal value for the same individual. Three key processes were emphasized: (1) creating a personal history to discover new narratives, (2) uncovering value through dialogue with a career designer, and (3) receiving insights from industry experts (interpreters). The hypothesis was then analyzed and examined through text-based online chat communications and one-on-one online coaching sessions conducted over several months with five Japanese business professionals.As a result of engaging in the hypothesized career design process, three of the five participants were able to clarify their personal meaning of work and build new careers. Analysis of the success factors revealed that the three emphasized processes were effective. For example:Participant A discovered (1) narratives such as \u201cthe confident self\u201d and \u201cthe self who loves making things\u201d from his personal history; (2) \u201cthe artisan-like self\u201d with the career designer; and (3) the career of \u201ctatami craftsman\u201d with the interpreter.Participant B discovered (1) the narrative of \u201cthe self interested in human behavior\u201d from his personal history; (2) \u201cthe self who enjoys experiencing nature\u201d with the career designer; and (3) the career of \u201cnature school instructor\u201d with the interpreter.Participant C discovered (1) the narrative of \u201cthe self who loves hospitality\u201d from his personal history; (2) \u201cthe self who helps the socially vulnerable\u201d with the career designer; and (3) the career of \u201ccoaching students at a free school\u201d with the interpreter.These findings highlight the importance of balancing coaching with critical dialogue. While traditional counseling emphasizes drawing meaning from the client, career designers must also encourage the questioning of assumptions and critical reflection. To reinforce extrinsic meaning, it is essential to propose specific occupations or work styles that align with both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions and demonstrate their significance.This research provides a career design process that addresses the challenge of lost meaning in work caused by technological advancement. By employing two design methodologies\u2014narrative and meaning innovation\u2014this process demonstrates the potential to generate both individual fulfillment and new societal value."}

This paper advocates for the systematic application of preference alignment techniques to music generation, addressing the fundamental gap between computational optimization and human musical appreciation. Drawing on recent breakthroughs including MusicRL's large-scale preference learning, multi-preference alignment frameworks like diffusion-based preference optimization in DiffRhythm+, and inference-time optimization techniques like Text2midi-InferAlign, we discuss how these techniques can address music's unique challenges: temporal coherence, harmonic consistency, and subjective quality assessment. We identify key research challenges including scalability to long-form compositions, reliability amongst others in preference modelling. Looking forward, we envision preference-aligned music generation enabling transformative applications in interactive composition tools and personalized music services. This work calls for sustained interdisciplinary research combining advances in machine learning, music-theory to create music AI systems that truly serve human creative and experiential needs."}

The citation count was noticeably right skewed, as articles with high citation counts inflated the mean. Members were mostly satisfied with the way the journal club was structured and managed. Members most valued the summary of the articles, followed by the live discussion. Opportunities for improvement included decreasing the number of journals scanned, decreasing detail in summaries, and using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate summary generation.

While LLMs and more broadly generative AI technologies are capable of providing excellent improvements for various routine and autonomous tasks thereby enabling cost and performance benefit, they are also prone to personal and societal harms such as biases, stereotypes, misinformation, and hallucinations to name a few. These ethical concerns have in turn triggered stakeholders across the world to call in for regulatory measures that ensure safe and beneficial use of generative AI technologies. In parallel, there are also research efforts to alleviate these issues through the development of generative AI bias detection and mitigating strategies. Towards advancing this goal, in this paper, we propose an accessible and end-user-friendly LLM diagnostic toolkit whereby diverse stakeholders such as software engineers, business executives, and consumers can examine a suite of LLMs for uncovering a host of ethical issues including biases and misinformation embedded in LLMs. We also demonstrate that our toolkit can be used to diagnose for issues related to commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on challenging tasks and datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our diagnostic toolkit."}

Employing a user-centred, mixed-methods design process, we co-developed an AI chatbot with lecturers to address recurring instructional challenges during exam preparation, specifically managing repetitive questions and scaling feedback delivery. The POC achieved its primary operational goals: lecturers reported streamlined workflows, reduced cognitive load, and observed improved student confidence in navigating course content. However, the deployment yielded unexpected insights into student learning behaviours. Despite enhanced teaching processes, performance data revealed no significant improvement in overall student assessment outcomes. Deep analysis of interaction logs identified concerning patterns, including self-efficacy-driven dependency,\"metacognitive laziness\"(cognitive offloading), and divergent usage strategies. While high-ability students leveraged the tool for strategic verification, low-ability students frequently used it to bypass cognitive effort, potentially exacerbating performance gaps. These findings suggest that Generative AI's educational influence extends beyond instructional efficiency to shape cognitive engagement, self-regulation, and learner equity. The study raises consequential design questions regarding how AI tools can be engineered to minimise dependency, scaffold metacognitive development, and calibrate support across varying ability levels. We conclude that while Generative AI can substantially enhance the teaching experience, achieving meaningful learning gains requires rigorous attention to learner behaviour and the equitable design of AI-supported environments."}

These concerns include lack of interpretability, bias and discrimination, privacy, lack of model robustness, fake and misleading content, copyright implications, plagiarism, and environmental impact associated with training and inference of generative AI models. In this tutorial, we first motivate the need for adopting responsible AI principles when developing and deploying large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models, as part of a broader AI model governance and responsible AI framework, from societal, legal, user, and model developer perspectives, and provide a roadmap for thinking about responsible AI for generative AI in practice. We provide a brief technical overview of text and image generation models, and highlight the key responsible AI desiderata associated with these models. We then describe the technical considerations and challenges associated with realizing the above desiderata in practice. We focus on real-world generative AI use cases spanning domains such as media generation, writing assistants, copywriting, code generation, and conversational assistants, present practical solution approaches / guidelines for applying responsible AI techniques effectively, discuss lessons learned from deploying responsible AI approaches for generative AI applications in practice, and highlight the key open research problems.

These results suggest human cognitive\u2013emotional responses to architectural forms are hardwired through evolution, privileging specific geometric patterns. Finally, ChatGPT o3 formulates ten detailed geometric rules for empathetic window design and composition.

Several models have been developed for image-to-image translation, particularly focusing on converting real-world images into anime through unpaired translation. Scenimefy, a notable approach utilizing contrastive learning, achieves high fidelity anime scene translation by addressing limited paired data through semi-supervised training. However, it faces limitations due to its reliance on paired data from a fine-tuned StyleGAN in the anime domain, often producing low-quality datasets. Additionally, Scenimefy's high parameter architecture presents opportunities for computational optimization. This research introduces NijiGAN, a novel model incorporating Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs), which offer unique advantages in continuous transformation modeling compared to traditional residual networks. NijiGAN successfully transforms real-world scenes into high fidelity anime visuals using half of Scenimefy's parameters. It employs pseudo-paired data generated through Scenimefy for supervised training, eliminating dependence on low-quality paired data and improving the training process. Our comprehensive evaluation includes ablation studies, qualitative, and quantitative analysis comparing NijiGAN to similar models. The testing results demonstrate that NijiGAN produces higher-quality images compared to AnimeGAN, as evidenced by a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 2.192, it surpasses AnimeGAN's MOS of 2.160. Furthermore, our model achieved a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 58.71, outperforming Scenimefy's FID score of 60.32. These results demonstrate that NijiGAN achieves competitive performance against existing state-of-the-arts, especially Scenimefy as the baseline model."}

We re-examined his fatal head wound through the lens of modern neurosurgery, focusing on projectile trajectory, biomechanics, skull base anatomy, fluid percussion, and periorbital injury, and including the use of artificial intelligence search. A systematic review was conducted using PubMed (n\u2009=\u200919) and Scopus (n\u2009=\u200912), along with 5 additional sources available on the Internet. Following PRISMA guidelines, 3 original studies were included. Historical autopsy documents were analyzed alongside contemporary literature. Generative AI models (Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, ChatGPT) were used to assist in triangulating ballistic and clinical interpretations. Separate autopsy reports by Woodward, Curtis, and Stone confirm a left occipital entry wound, with the bullet traveling posterior-anterior through the left hemisphere and lodging above the corpus striatum. The absence of midline crossover is consistent across modern reconstructions. Bilateral orbital fractures and right-sided ecchymosis are best attributed to heightened pressure-wave dynamics, not to direct trauma or contrecoup effects. Lincoln\u2019s injury represents a non-survivable low-velocity penetrating brain injury. The forensic and neurosurgical evidence supports a strictly left-sided trajectory, possible basal skull fractures, and pressure-driven orbital injury."}

Despite stark differences, there are core similarities between the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face life-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical providers experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare environment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a life-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to efficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing power becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as electronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases, it is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology. Recently, generative AI has captivated the research community, leading to debates about its application in healthcare, mainly due to concerns about transparency and related issues. Meanwhile, concerns about the potential exacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable ethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However, the ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied, and decision-makers often fail to consider the significance of generative AI. In this paper, we propose GREAT PLEA ethical principles, encompassing governance, reliability, equity, accountability, traceability, privacy, lawfulness, empathy, and autonomy, for generative AI in healthcare. We aim to proactively address the ethical dilemmas and challenges posed by the integration of generative AI in healthcare."}

Generative AI can be processed visually for navigation in conjunction with visual intelligence through mixed reality technology, thereby adding practical learning and character design for animation purposes. This research focuses on the application of generative AI technology combined with visual processing to develop digital teachers with intelligent visual abilities using mixed reality technology, to enable the creation of more dimensional and interactive practical learning experiences, especially in the field of character design for animation. Using visual intelligence allows learners to learn better using a hands-on approach, which improves learners' design and creative skills in a hybrid reality and digital environment. Education for digital teacher design can use generative AI that can be processed visually for navigation with the aid of visual intelligence. This study was conducted in the form of an observational study supported by a literature review to study the elements and processes for modeling the design of digital teachers. Use questionnaires to assess the modeling process and digital teacher design process. The researcher evaluated the design process using 3 practical teachers, 3 gen-ai experts, 3 visual intelligence experts, and 3 MR technology experts, for a total of 12 people. The evaluation led to an average value of 4.69 \u00b1 0.40, with an average value of 4.69 \u00b1 0.40 (the highest quality). Generative AI that can process visuals for navigation with visual intelligence through mixed reality technology enhances the practical learning of character design for animation, resulting in learners being able to effectively develop important skills and be highly involved in the learning process. The use of mixed reality technology enhances the immersive and engaging learning experience for learners. It is effective and can increase the learning of character design for animation work, which can be applied in teaching and learning management in the future."}

Specifically, the network would take, as input, features derived directly from binaries and output English descriptions of functionality to aid a reverse engineer in investigating the capabilities of a piece of closed-source software, be it malicious or benign. Given recent success in applying large language models (generative AI) to the task of source code summarization, this seems a promising direction. However, in our initial survey of the available datasets, we found nothing of sufficiently high quality and volume to train these complex models. Instead, we build our own dataset derived from a capture of Stack Overflow containing 1.1M entries. A major result of our work is a novel dataset evaluation method using the correlation between two distances on sample pairs: one distance in the embedding space of inputs and the other in the embedding space of outputs. Intuitively, if two samples have inputs close in the input embedding space, their outputs should also be close in the output embedding space. We found this Embedding Distance Correlation (EDC) test to be highly diagnostic, indicating that our collected dataset and several existing open-source datasets are of low quality as the distances are not well correlated. We proceed to explore the general applicability of EDC, applying it to a number of qualitatively known good datasets and a number of synthetically known bad ones and found it to be a reliable indicator of dataset value."}

However, students often lack the necessary training or knowledge to produce such content. To address this gap, this paper explores the potential of incorporating generative AI (GenAI) to review students\u2019 work and provide them with real-time feedback and assistance during content creation. Specifically, we use RiPPLE, which enables students to create bite-size learning resources and incorporates instant GenAI feedback, highlighting strengths and suggesting improvements to enhance quality. The AI reviews the resource and pro ideas feedback encompassing three main components: a summary of the resource, a list of strengths, and suggestions for improvement. We evaluate this approach by analyzing log data from 1063 student-created multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and the corresponding AI feedback. This analysis aims to understand the depth, scope, and tone of the feedback provided by the AI, as well as the way students engage with and utilize this feedback in their content creation process. Additionally, we examined the perceived helpfulness of the GenAI feedback analyzed via 3324 student ratings and thematically analyzed 601 comments they provided about the feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential value of AI-generated feedback for students when integrated into pedagogical design. Our analysis suggests that not only can AI-generated feedback provide students with a breadth of feedback to improve their writing and/or discipline-specific content knowledge, but also it is largely well received by students for both its clarity and its positive tone. Despite challenges in ensuring the accuracy of AI-generated feedback, this study shows how this feedback can enable students to make actionable changes in their academic performance.\u00a0"}

These changes mean it is timely to revisit academic integrity within the UK Higher Education computing community. The aim of this research is to explore the current perspectives of senior computing academics on academic integrity and student cheating, particularly given the rapid development of generative AI tools and resources and the growth in essay mills. An exploratory research approach was adopted using a mixed methods approach. A critical literature review was undertaken and this together with the researcher team's expertise was used to underpin the design of the practical research activities. A survey was conducted of UK higher education senior academics (response rate, $\\mathrm{n}=16$). The results from this informed a set of in-depth individual semistructured interviews with senior UK computing academics $(\\mathrm{n}=5)$. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the quantitative survey data and exploratory thematic analysis undertaken with the qualitative data from the survey and interviews. Methodological triangulation was used across these data sets to inform the key findings and their interpretation and discussion. The findings demonstrate that senior computing academics are concerned about the levels and types of student cheating on their assessed work. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted, with no simple solution. Academic misconduct is perceived to adversely affect academic standards. Challenges with the detection and investigation of student cheating and the need to ensure consistency of approach by all staff are highlighted. Action is needed urgently and respondents emphasize that this should focus on prevention rather than detection of academic misconduct. These findings have informed a set of recommendations to promote good academic practice and integrity across the UK Higher Education computing community. The findings also highlight that in order to implement these recommendations, staff, students and their departments/institutions need to come together and draw on each others' expertise and experiences to enable a high-quality ethical learning experience."}

These types of environments can contribute to the optimization of resource use, enhanced quality of life, and prioritization of sustainability while at the same time safeguarding user privacy through decentralized, edge\u2010driven AI solutions.

While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration. Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend: Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding.

To overcome these challenges, we develop TamGen, a method that employs a GPT-like chemical language model and enables target-aware molecule generation and compound refinement. We demonstrate that the compounds generated by TamGen have improved molecular quality and viability.

It is also a difficult question, for two reasons. First, \"generative AI\" is not just one product from one company. It is a catch-all name for a massive ecosystem of loosely related technologies. These systems behave differently and raise different legal issues. Second, copyright law is notoriously complicated, and generative-AI systems manage to touch on a great many corners of it. They raise issues of authorship, similarity, direct and indirect liability, and fair use, among much else. These issues cannot be analyzed in isolation, because there are connections everywhere. We aim to bring order to the chaos. To do so, we introduce the generative-AI supply chain: an interconnected set of stages that transform training data into generations. The supply chain reveals all of the places at which companies and users make choices that have copyright consequences. It enables us to trace the effects of upstream technical designs on downstream uses, and to assess who in these complicated sociotechnical systems bears responsibility for infringement when it happens. Because we engage so closely with the technology of generative AI, we are able to shed more light on the copyright questions. We identify the key decisions that courts will need to make as they grapple with these issues, and point out the consequences that would likely flow from different liability regimes.

We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data transformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their representational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence dynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact, resolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly parallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future hybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual transform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and simultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the concept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a powerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78)\"transform\", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad compressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic universality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three transforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and computational cost. We discuss how these insights extend beyond compression to tasks such as classification, denoising, and generative AI, suggesting new pathways for using non-linear transformations to balance resource constraints and performance."}

Drawing on six major ethical theories - virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, contract theory, care ethics, and existentialism - we develop a\"compass\"to navigate and reflect on the ethical dimensions of AI in design. The framework highlights the importance of responsibility, anticipation, and reflection across both the AI lifecycle and each stage of the creative process.

This minimizes both bone and metal artifacts and results in a pure image of the vessels. However, carrying out the examination twice means double the radiation dose for the patient. With the help of generative AI, it could be possible to simulate subtraction angiographies from contrast-enhanced 3D angiographies and thus reduce the need for another dose of radiation without a cutback in quality. We implemented this concept by using conditional generative adversarial networks. We selected all 3D subtraction angiographies from our PACS system, which had performed between 01/01/2018 and 12/31/2022 and randomly divided them into training, validation, and test sets (66%:17%:17%). We adapted the pix2pix framework to work on 3D data and trained a conditional generative adversarial network with 621 data sets. Additionally, we used 158 data sets for validation and 164 for testing. We evaluated two test sets with (n\u2009=\u200972) and without artifacts (n\u2009=\u200992). Five (blinded) neuroradiologists compared these datasets with the original subtraction dataset. They assessed similarity, subjective image quality, and severity of artifacts. Image quality and subjective diagnostic accuracy of the virtual subtraction angiographies revealed no significant differences compared to the original 3D angiographies. While bone and movement artifact level were reduced, artifact level caused by metal implants differed from case to case between both angiographies without one group being significant superior to the other. Conditional generative adversarial networks can be used to simulate subtraction angiographies in clinical practice, however, new artifacts can also appear as a result of this technology."}

The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) mandates the alignment of Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) programs with its 2021 Essentials, a competency-based educational framework encompassing hundreds of specific standards. This study aims to evaluate a novel use of Gen AI: how effectively can a custom-trained gen AI tool (custom GPT from ChatGPT), align FNP course assessments with the AACN\u2019s New Essentials, thereby potentially reducing faculty workload and improving curriculum accuracy.Methods: Through dialogue and uploading of relevant documents, a custom GPT (called Mapper) was trained from one FNP course to the subcompentencies within the 2021 Essentials. The Mapper was then used to align the assessments from one FNP course. The Mapper\u2019s output was then compared to content expert alignments to assess accuracy.Results: Across all 10 domains of the AACN Essentials, the Mapper aligned with expert analysis with moderate to high accuracy. Initial analysis indicated correct alignment rate from 44% to 93% (average 66%), which improved to 70% (p < .05) upon further refinement of the Mapper tool by content expert. Potential novel alignments (average 26%), and misalignments (average 9%), provided by the Mapper were critically reviewed, leading to adjustments to the content expert\u2019s original alignment, which enhanced the overall precision of the alignment. For example, misalignments were reduced to only 5% (p < .05). In post-analysis, Mapper aligned AACN subcompetencies incorrectly on average 4%, while the lead faculty was incorrect on average 6%.Conclusions: Gen AI has the potential to streamline the complex process of aligning curriculum to national standards. The GPT demonstrated a significant capacity to assist in this task with minimal error rates, but expert oversight remained crucial to ensure accuracy and relevance. This synergy between Gen AI and human expertise points to a promising avenue for enhancing curriculum development and alignment processes in nursing education and other disciplines."}

However, it may happen that data storytellers lack the competences to build compelling texts to include in the data-driven stories. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to enhance DS by automatically generating context for data-driven stories, leveraging the capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI). This contextual information provides the background knowledge necessary for the audience to understand the story's message fully. Our approach uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which adapts large language models (LLMs), the core concept behind GenAI, to the specific domain required by a data-driven story. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a practical case study on salmon aquaculture, showcasing the ability of GenAI to enrich DS with relevant context. We also describe some possible strategies to evaluate the generated context and ethical issues may raise when using GenAI in DS."}

However, scaling these discoveries to industrial production remains a major bottleneck due to the synthesis gap -- the need to develop entirely new manufacturing processes. This challenge requires detailed engineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows, and PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably generate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle to manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop, physics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates three key components: (1) domain-specialized small language models (SLMs) trained for auto-generation of PFDs and PIDs, (2) a hierarchical knowledge graph containing process flow and instrumentation descriptions for 1,020+ chemicals for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG), and (3) an open-source chemical process simulator for modeling, simulation, optimization, and analysis of novel chemical processes. The SLMs are trained through a multi-stage pipeline on synthetic datasets, with process simulator-in-the-loop validation ensuring feasibility. To enhance computational efficiency, the framework implements structural pruning (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce language model size while preserving accuracy, followed by advanced inference optimizations including FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization, and Test-Time Inference Scaling. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity."}

The hPSC-derived cardiac organoids are commonly characterized by bright-field microscopic imaging for tracking daily organoid differentiation and morphology formation. Although the brightfield microscope provides essential information about hPSC- derived cardiac organoids, such as morphology, size, and general structure, it does not extend our understanding of cardiac organoids on cell type-specific distribution and structure. Then, fluorescence microscopic imaging is required to identify the specific cardiovascular cell types in the hPSC-derived cardiac organoids by fluorescence immunostaining fixed organoid samples or fluorescence reporter imaging of live organoids. Both approaches require extra steps of experiments and techniques and do not provide general information on hPSC-derived cardiac organoids from different batches of differentiation and characterization, which limits the biomedical applications of hPSC-derived cardiac organoids. This research addresses this limitation by proposing a comprehensive workflow for colorizing phase contrast images of cardiac organoids from brightfield microscopic imaging using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to provide cardiovascular cell type-specific information in hPSC-derived cardiac organoids. By infusing these phase contrast images with accurate fluorescence colorization, our approach aims to unlock the hidden wealth of cell type, structure, and further quantifications of fluorescence intensity and area, for better characterizing hPSC-derived cardiac organoids."}

In this conception, learners continually converse with AI language models and other human learners within a dynamic computational medium of internet tools and resources. Learning happens when this distributed human-AI system sets goals, builds meaning from data, consolidates understanding, reconciles differences, and transfers knowledge to new domains. Building social generative AI for education will require development of powerful AI systems that can converse with each other as well as humans, construct external representations such as knowledge maps, access and contribute to internet resources, and act as teachers, learners, guides and mentors. This raises fundamental problems of ethics. Such systems should be aware of their limitations, their responsibility to learners and the integrity of the internet, and their respect for human teachers and experts. We need to consider how to design and constrain social generative AI for education."}

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly woven into daily human experiences, individuals are turning to it for emotional support and companionship, as seen in narratives of emotional relationships with generative AI. The research aims to understand how direct interactions with artificial intelligence influence perceptions of its utility and emotional closeness, contrasting these with indirect interactions. Employing a qualitative approach, the researchers conducted in-depth interviews, which reveal that initial skepticism about artificial intelligence diminishes with increased usage. Informants start recognizing artificial intelligence not just as a tool but as a companion providing non-judgmental support, facilitated by artificial intelligence-mediated communication. Findings suggest a significant perceptual shift among users, viewing artificial intelligence as capable of fulfilling emotional roles in human relationships. This research contributes to Human- Machine Communication by highlighting the qualitative nuances in how artificial intelligence is embedded in daily life, affecting social and emotional interactions. The research underscores artificial intelligence's potential not only in enhancing productivity but also in serving as a meaningful social and emotional partner.

An Interactive Cognitive Offload (ICO) framework is proposed in this paper, which uses generative AI as a tool for strategically assigning mechanical writing tasks. A mixed-method study comparing ICO students and controls showed that ICO significantly improved critical thinking skills, especially in the depth of argument and evidence synthesis. The analysis showed that ICO was effective in reducing extraneous cognitive load (32%, p < .001) while increasing germane cognitive load (28%, p = .004), and there was no significant difference between groups \u2014 allowing students to focus on higher-order thinking. In addition to the positive correlation between increased germane load and these critical thinking dimensions (r = .59-.62, p < .001) and evidence synthesis (r = -.65, p < .001), there was strong negative correlation between increased germane load and these critical thinking dimensions (r = .59-.62, p < .001), confirming a \"cognitive reinvestment\" mechanism. Qualitative findings identified key patterns in agency negotiation: strategic delegation, reflection triggered by AI outputs, and critical assessment of AI proposals. In order to address potential limitations, the results were improved by adding cognitive load measurements to real-time observation records, as well as multiple validation strategies for thematic analysis. These results indicate that ICO framework transforms generative AI into a metacognitive framework for writing critical thinking. Implications suggest that the ICO framework effectively reduces the risk of cognitive surrogacy through structured collaboration and provides a viable model for using artificial intelligence to augment basic intellectual skills."}

While responsible and ethical applications could bring opportunities to education, their misuse could pose demanding challenges. It is necessary to clarify the technological affordances and challenges in a normative way to lay the foundation for future development. This study addressed the dearth of literature by performing a systematic review, aiming to (i) explore the utility and availability from the technological affordances perspective; (ii) summarize the current challenges in risks prevention; and (iii) propose possible directions for future research and practice. A total of 27 academic articles published in core journals between 2020 and 2023 were analyzed, and the inductive grounded approach was used to categorize the coding schemes. The findings revealed four technological affordances: accessibility, personalization, automation, and interactivity; and five challenges: academic integrity risk, response errors and bias, over-dependence risk, the widening digital divide, and privacy and security. We propose future directions, encourage educational organizations to formulate guidelines for the ethical use of AI in education, call on educators to embrace future trends in AI education instead of shunning its use, and guide students to treat it as a thought aid and reference, rather than relying on it entirely."}

In a first AI experiment, the large language model ChatGPT-4o generated six visual environments that are expected to boost creative thinking for their occupants. The six test cases are evaluated using Christopher Alexander\u2019s 15 fundamental properties of living geometry as criteria, as well as ChatGPT-4o, to reveal a strong positive correlation. Living geometry is a specific type of geometry that shows coherence across scales, fractal structure, and nested symmetries to harmonize with human neurophysiology. The human need for living geometry is supported by interdisciplinary evidence from biology, environmental psychology, and neuroscience. Then, in a second AI experiment, ChatGPT-4o was asked to generate visual environments that suppress creativity for comparison with the cases that boost creative thinking. Checking these negative examples using Alexander\u2019s 15 fundamental properties, they are almost entirely deficient in living geometry, thus confirming the diagnostic model. Used together with generative AI, living geometry therefore offers a useful method for both creating and evaluating designs based on objective criteria. Adopting a hybrid epistemological framework of AI plus living geometry as a basis for design uncovers a flaw within contemporary architectural practice. Dominant design styles, rooted in untested aesthetic preferences, lack the empirical validation required to address fundamental questions of spatial quality responsible for human creativity."}

This research introduces an approach that retrieves previously fact-checked claims, evaluates their relevance to a given input, and provides supplementary information to support fact-checkers. Our method employs large language models (LLMs) to filter irrelevant fact-checks and generate concise summaries and explanations, enabling fact-checkers to faster assess whether a claim has been verified before. In addition, we evaluate our approach through both automatic and human assessments, where humans interact with the developed tool to review its effectiveness.

Given the rapid rise of AI-based platforms in educational sector, understanding their adoption is not only timely but also essential for ensuring equitable and effective learning outcomes. Addressing a critical research gap in understanding of rapidly evolving EdTech sector, the research blends constructs such as learning interest, achievement goals, self-efficacy, and subjective norms in expanding the typical TAM model. This integrative approach allows for a more holistic framework that captures both technological perceptions and learner-driven motivational factors, making the model especially relevant in emerging economies where educational technology adoption varies widely. Data were gathered using an online survey via Google Forms, providing 346 valid responses from students. The sample consisted of students from diverse academic disciplines, ensures representativeness across different fields of study and thereby enhancing the generalizability of the results. The data was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) through SmartPLS-3 software. The findings support the extended TAM model which indicated that learning interest and achievement goals have significant impact on \u00a0perceived ease of use. Self-efficacy and subjective norms have significant impact on perceived usefulness and behavioral intention has significant impact on actual usage, demonstrating its pivotal role in technology adoption. These relationships suggest that motivation-related constructs are not peripheral but central in shaping how students interact with AI-powered platforms. This study advances the literature on educational technology by establishing a new TAM model as applied to AI-powered learning tools in emerging economies. The practical implications are that developers of Deepseek need to make the platform more user-centered in order to increase adoption. Future research avenues involve analyzing other contextual factors and longitudinal patterns of adoption over time. These findings provide useful insights for stakeholders who want to maximize AI learning tool integration in universities."}

Time reversal is achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate, which can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new synthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order.

However, current foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) perform poorly when tasked with generating accurate International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Additionally, there are many security and financial challenges in the application of generative AI to healthcare. We present a strategy for developing generative AI tools in healthcare, specifically for medical billing and coding, that balances accuracy, accessibility, and patient privacy. Methods: We fine tune the PHI-3 Mini and PHI-3 Medium LLMs using institutional data and compare the results against the PHI-3 base model, a PHI-3 RAG application, and GPT-4o. We use the post operative surgical report as input and the patients billing claim the associated ICD-10, CPT, and Modifier codes as the target result. Performance is measured by accuracy of code generation, proportion of invalid codes, and the fidelity of the billing claim format. Results: Both fine-tuned models performed better or as well as GPT-4o. The Phi-3 Medium fine-tuned model showed the best performance (ICD-10 Recall and Precision: 72%, 72%; CPT Recall and Precision: 77%, 79%; Modifier Recall and Precision: 63%, 64%). The Phi-3 Medium fine-tuned model only fabricated 1% of ICD-10 codes and 0.6% of CPT codes generated. Conclusions: Our study shows that a small model that is fine-tuned on domain-specific data for specific tasks using a simple set of open-source tools and minimal technological and monetary requirements performs as well as the larger contemporary consumer models."}

Existing works often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in online resources."}

Guided by Alami and Ernst\u2019s (2025) findings on AI-generated feedback for code review, we introduce a vibe coded AI/Voice based code review prototype as a provotype (Boer and Donovan, 2012). We then outline an explorative study to critically assess the socio-technical effects of using AI based voice interfaces in code reviews. We propose a qualitative approach, based on the Disruptive Research Playbook (Storey et al., 2024), involving Danish software developers to investigate voice-based feedback's impact on topics including trust, collaboration, and perceived skill shifts. Initial methodological reflections emphasize the need for cautious exploration using the provotype as an intervention for gathering data in the form of reactions, expectations, and concern about the effects of AI interactions, in the established professional practise of code review. Next steps are to finalize the provotype, complete the research design and collect and analyze qualitative data from interventions with danish software developer teams."}

However, achieving a performance balance between communication and sensing in the dual-function radar communication (DFRC)-based ISAC system remains a significant challenge. In this paper, a low-altitude intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted ISAC system is explored, where a base station (BS) supports dual-functional operations, enabling both data transmission for multiple users and sensing for a blocked target, with the channel quality enhanced by an IRS mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Moreover, we formulate an integrated communication, sensing, and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (CSEMOP), which aims to maximize the communication rate of the users and the sensing rate of the target, while minimizing UAV propulsion energy consumption by jointly optimizing the BS beamforming matrix, IRS phase shifts, the flight velocity and angle of the UAV. Considering the non-convexity, trade-off, and dynamic nature of the formulated CSEMOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-based deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMDDPG) algorithm to solve the problem. Specifically, the diffusion model is incorporated into the actor network of DDPG to improve the action quality, with noise perturbation mechanism for better exploration and recent prioritized experience replay (RPER) sampling mechanism for enhanced training efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the GDMDDPG algorithm delivers superior performance compared to the existing methods."}

In this paper, we design and evaluate an automated question generation tool for formative and summative assessment in schools. We present an expert survey of one hundred and four teachers, demonstrating the need for automated generation of QBAs, as a tool that can significantly reduce the workload of teachers and facilitate personalized learning experiences. Leveraging the recent advancements in generative AI, we then present a modular framework employing transformer based language models for automatic generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from textual content. The presented solution, with distinct modules for question generation, correct answer prediction, and distractor formulation, enables us to evaluate different language models and generation techniques. Finally, we perform an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, demonstrating trade-offs in the use of different techniques and models."}

When Duolingo and Babbel added AI features to their language learning apps, the games that users play on the apps was transformed, giving us a window into the structure of AI\u2010driven user interactions in general. Dynamic, turn\u2010taking dialogues resembling natural conversation now appear alongside multiple\u2010choice and drag\u2010and\u2010drop vocabulary games. The transformation is not just technological: It also lays bare the shifting language games that we have come to play more broadly in our interactions with LLMs such as Chat\u2010GPT, Claude, and Gemini. People engage with them in back\u2010and\u2010forth conversations in which different kinds of speech acts are at play. By contrast, traditional conversational agents based on decision\u2010tree learning rely on discrete, finite, and close\u2010ended commands. The paper argues that the future of AI conversation is one in which rule\u2010based interactions co\u2010exist with intention\u2010based interactions powered by generative AI. Design elements on Duolingo, in particular, draw on diverse styles of communication and offer guidance to ensure that conversational AI platforms in general remain open to new forms of dialogue that enrich both artificial and natural conversation alike."}

Powered by foundation models that have been pretrained and can generate complex content, GenAI represents a paradigm shift away from the more traditional focus on task-specific classifiers that have dominated the AI landscape thus far. We posit that the imminent application of GenAI in healthcare will be through well-defined, low risk, high value, and narrow applications that automate healthcare workflows at the point of care using smaller foundation models. These models will be finetuned for different capabilities and application specific scenarios and will have the ability to provide medical explanations, reference evidence within a retrieval augmented framework and utilizing external tools. We contrast this with a general, all-purpose AI model for end-to-end clinical decision making that improves clinician performance, including safety-critical diagnostic tasks, which will require greater research prior to implementation. We consider areas where 'human in the loop' Generative AI can improve healthcare quality and safety by automating mundane tasks. Using the principles of implementation science will be critical for integrating 'end to end' GenAI systems that will be accepted by healthcare teams."}

Amid concerns about declining writing standards, this study investigates the role of ChatGPT in facilitating writing, especially among language learners. Using a case study approach, this study examines the experiences of Kailing, a doctoral student, who integrates ChatGPT throughout their writing process. The study employs activity theory as a lens for understanding writing with generative AI tools and data analyzed includes semi-structured interviews, writing samples, and GPT logs. Results indicate that Kailing effectively collaborates with ChatGPT across various writing stages while preserving her distinct authorial voice and agency. This underscores the potential of AI tools such as ChatGPT to enhance writing for language learners without overshadowing individual authenticity. This case study offers a critical exploration of how ChatGPT is utilized in the writing process and the preservation of a student\u2019s authentic voice when engaging with the tool."}

However, existing generative AI mostly focuses on producing visually pleasant artworks, without emphasizing the painting process. We introduce a novel task, Collaborative Neural Painting (CNP), to facilitate collaborative art painting generation between humans and machines. Given any number of user-input brushstrokes as the context or just the desired object class, CNP should produce a sequence of strokes supporting the completion of a coherent painting. Importantly, the process can be gradual and iterative, so allowing users' modifications at any phase until the completion. Moreover, we propose to solve this task using a painting representation based on a sequence of parametrized strokes, which makes it easy both editing and composition operations. These parametrized strokes are processed by a Transformer-based architecture with a novel attention mechanism to model the relationship between the input strokes and the strokes to complete. We also propose a new masking scheme to reflect the interactive nature of CNP and adopt diffusion models as the basic learning process for its effectiveness and diversity in the generative field. Finally, to develop and validate methods on the novel task, we introduce a new dataset of painted objects and an evaluation protocol to benchmark CNP both quantitatively and qualitatively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the potential of the CNP task as a promising avenue for future research."}

Despite the evident success of these methods and the rapid growth of this field in the power systems community, there is still a pressing need for a deeper understanding of how different evaluation metrics relate to the underlying statistical structure of the models. Another related important question is what tools can be used to quantify the different uncertainties, which are inherent in these problems, and stem not only from the physical system but also from the nature of the generative model itself. This paper attempts to address these challenges and provides a comprehensive review of existing evaluation metrics for generative models applied in various power system tasks. We analyze how these metrics align with the statistical properties of the models and explore their strengths and limitations. We also examine different sources of uncertainty, distinguishing between uncertainties inherent to the learning model, those arising from measurement errors, and other sources. Our general aim is to promote a better understanding of generative models as they are being applied in power systems to support this fascinating growing trend."}
