For machines to assist in information gathering, it is therefore essential to enable them to answer conversational questions. We introduce CoQA, a novel dataset for building Conversational Question Answering systems. Our dataset contains 127k questions with answers, obtained from 8k conversations about text passages from seven diverse domains. The questions are conversational, and the answers are free-form text with their corresponding evidence highlighted in the passage. We analyze CoQA in depth and show that conversational questions have challenging phenomena not present in existing reading comprehension datasets, e.g., coreference and pragmatic reasoning. We evaluate strong conversational and reading comprehension models on CoQA. The best system obtains an F1 score of 65.4\\%, which is 23.4 points behind human performance (88.8\\%), indicating there is ample room for improvement. \n\n[1] Title: SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text Abstract: We present the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), a new reading comprehension dataset consisting of 100,000+ questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a segment of text from the corresponding reading passage. We analyze the dataset to understand the types of reasoning required to answer the questions, leaning heavily on dependency and constituency trees. We build a strong logistic regression model, which achieves an F1 score of 51.0\\%, a significant improvement over a simple baseline (20\\%). However, human performance (86.8\\%) is much higher, indicating that the dataset presents a good challenge problem for future research.\n\n[2] Title: Interpretation of natural language rules in conversational machine reading Abstract: Most work in machine reading focuses on question answering problems where the answer is directly expressed in the text to read. However, many real-world question answering problems require the reading of text not because it contains the literal answer, but because it contains a recipe to derive an answer together with the reader's background knowledge. One example is the task of interpreting regulations to answer \"Can I...?\" or \"Do I have to...?\" questions such as \"I am working in Canada. Do I have to carry on paying UK National Insurance?\" after reading a UK government website about this topic. This task requires both the interpretation of rules and the application of background knowledge. It is further complicated due to the fact that, in practice, most questions are underspecified, and a human assistant will regularly have to ask clarification questions such as How long have you been working abroad? when the answer cannot be directly derived from the question and text. In this paper, we formalise this task and develop a crowd-sourcing strategy to collect 32k task instances based on real-world rules and crowd-generated questions and scenarios. We analyse the challenges of this task and assess its difficulty by evaluating the performance of rule-based and machine-learning baselines. We observe promising results when no background knowledge is necessary, and substantial room for improvement whenever background knowledge is needed.\n\n[3] Title: Passage Re-ranking with BERT Abstract: Recently, neural models pretrained on a language modeling task, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2017), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), have achieved impressive results on various natural language processing tasks such as question-answering and natural language inference. In this paper, we describe a simple re-implementation of BERT for query-based passage re-ranking. Our system is the state of the art on the TREC-CAR dataset and the top entry in the leaderboard of the MS MARCO passage retrieval task, outperforming the previous state of the art by 27\\% (relative) in MRR@10. \n\n[4] Title: Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension Abstract: Machine comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context paragraph, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the query. Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC. Typically these methods use attention to focus on a small portion of the context and summarize it with a fixed-size vector, couple attentions temporally, and/or often form a uni-directional attention. In this paper we introduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of granularity and uses bi-directional attention flow mechanism to obtain a query-aware context representation without early summarization. Our experimental evaluations show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results in Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and CNN/DailyMail cloze test.\n\n\nAbstract: We present QuAC, a dataset for Question Answering in Context that contains 14K information-seeking QA dialogs (100K questions in total). The dialogs involve two crowd workers: (1) a student who poses a sequence of freeform questions to learn as much as possible about a hidden Wikipedia text, and (2) a teacher who answers the questions by providing short excerpts from the text. QuAC introduces challenges not found in existing machine comprehension datasets: its questions are often more open-ended, unanswerable, or only meaningful within the dialog context, as we show in a detailed qualitative evaluation. We also report results for a number of reference models, including a recently state-of-the-art reading comprehension architecture extended to model dialog context. Our best model underperforms humans by 20 F1, suggesting that there is significant room for future work on this data. \nInnovation: \n[Response_Start]\nThis work builds on span based reading comprehension [1] while also incorporating innovations such as curating questions independently of supporting text to reduce trivial lexical overlap. \nConcurrent to this work, [2] proposed a task of generating and answering yes/no questions for rule focused text (such as traffic laws) by interacting with a user through dialog. \nAlso concurrently, [0] propose conversational question answering (CoQA) from text but allow both students and questioners to see the evidence. \n[Response_End]\nNow, please generate another related work given the following abstract.\n##\nReferences:\n [0].

Title:A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT. Abstract:Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC.\n[6].

Abstract:ABSTRACT The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents a watershed moment in the evolution of digital platforms. The capabilities of this AI technology go beyond traditional AI systems, enabling the autonomous generation of novel outcomes with significant implications for platform value creation, architecture, governance, and stakeholder interactions. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that identifies four key mechanisms through which GenAI transforms digital platforms: intelligent automation, democratization, hyper-personalization, and collaborative innovation. Through intelligent automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization systematically lowers barriers to platform participation. Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value co-creation. We use this framework to situate the papers in the special issue and develop a research agenda that explores the transformative impact of GenAI on platform stakeholder relationships.\n[8].
